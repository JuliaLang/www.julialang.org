# Julia Hackathons

## Current Hackathon: First World Wide Virtual Julia Language Hackathon on April 17th

This first hackathon will be hosted on Zoom which will allow us to have breakout rooms. The plan is to have a main room as a waiting room for logistical stuff and then different breakout rooms where the actual hacking/building will take place. [Based on this survey that we put together](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYdr3T1i6jLee1ES2PfJ-MRadjlDAQQGTVx3vrquceLGCTyg/viewform?usp=sf_link), we will have a number of high level rooms for topics like Data Science, Visualization, Machine Learning, etc. and then if there are groups that form within those highlevel domains who want to move to a different room for a specific project, we can facilitate that.

[Breakout Room List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sp4Y1s8kUFHRZ9UWDGmwxZprH6O1Wgo7jIT9VQPpCVw/edit?usp=sharing)

Everyone will be given Co-Host permission so they can move freely between breakout rooms.

## When

Friday April 17th. We will have multiple kickoffs for various time zones:  
 - Europe/Asia Kick off 10 AM (UTC +1 London Time), [5 AM EDT]
 - US East Coast Kick off 10 AM EDT (UTC -4)

# Will there be any talks or demos at this Hackathon?

While not officially part of this Hackathon, there will be a talk titled: PackageCompiler and Static Compilation in Julia from 12pm â€“ 1pm EDT on Friday. Details below:

~~~<blockquote class="blockquote">~~~

Register here [https://form.jotform.me/200931129844454](https://form.jotform.me/200931129844454) for a free Webinar on "PackageCompiler and Static Compilation in Julia".

Know how one can use PackageCompiler.jl to cache the loading and compiled code of functions in packages, effectively removing the compilation overhead.

You will also learn how to create apps - executable programs that can be run on other machines without requiring Julia installation and without having to provide the source code.

The Webinar is led by JuliaHub's @KristofferC89, who is a long-time contributor to Julia, PackageCompiler.jl, the Julia package manager and debugger.
