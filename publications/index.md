<p><span class="citation">1. <strong>Julia: A fresh approach to numerical computing</strong>. Jeff Bezanson, Alan Edelman, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah (2014), <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1607" class="uri">http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1607</a><p><blockquote><em>Abstract:</em> The Julia programming language is gaining enormous popularity. Julia was designed to be easy and fast. Most importantly, Julia shatters deeply established notions widely held in the applied community:1. High-level, dynamic code has to be slow by some sort of law of nature. 2. It is sensible to prototype in one language and then recode in another language. 3. There are parts of a system for the programmer, and other parts best left untouched as they are built by the experts.Julia began with a deep understanding of the needs of the scientific programmer and the needs of the computer in mind. Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from computer science and computational science creating a new approach to scientific computing. This note introduces the programmer to the language and the underlying design theory. It invites the reader to rethink the fundamental foundations of numerical computing systems.In particular, there is the fascinating dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. We can pick just the right algorithm for the right circumstance and this can happen at runtime based on argument types (code selection via multiple dispatch). Abstraction recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away and ignored as irrelevant. The recognition of abstraction allows for code reuse (generic programming). A simple idea that yields incredible power. The Julia design facilitates this interplay in many explicit and subtle ways for machine performance and, most importantly, human convenience.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Tobias Knopp (2014), <em>HPTCDL’14 Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on High Performance Technical Computing in Dynamic Languages</em>, 1–5, doi:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HPTCDL.2014.11">10.1109/HPTCDL.2014.11</a><p><blockquote><em>Abstract:</em> Julia is a young programming language that is designed for technical computing. Although Julia is dynamically typed it is very fast and usually yields C speed by utilizing a just-in-time compiler. Still, Julia has a simple syntax that is similar to Matlab, which is widely known as an easy-to-use programming environment. While Julia is very versatile and provides asynchronous programming facilities in the form of tasks (coroutines) as well as distributed multi-process parallelism, one missing feature is shared memory multi-threading. In this paper we present our experiment on introducing multi-threading support in the Julia programming environment. While our implementation has some restrictions that have to be taken into account when using threads, the results are promising yielding almost full speedup for perfectly parallelizable tasks.</blockquote></p></span></p>

The ability to reuse a single codebase for all these purposes provides new ways to understand and verify parallel programs.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Jeff Bezanson, Jiahao Chen, Stefan Karpinski, Viral Shah, Alan Edelman (2014), <em>ARRAY’14 Proceedings of ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Libraries, Languages, and Compilers for Array Programming</em>, 56–61, doi:<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2627373.2627383">10.1145/2627373.2627383</a>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3845" class="uri">http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3845</a><p><blockquote><em>Abstract:</em> Arrays are such a rich and fundamental data type that they tend to be built into a language, either in the compiler or in a large low-level library. Defining this functionality at the user level instead provides greater flexibility for application domains not envisioned by the language designer. Only a few languages, such as C++ and Haskell, provide the necessary power to define n-dimensional arrays, but these systems rely on compile-time abstraction, sacrificing some flexibility. In contrast, dynamic languages make it straightforward for the user to define any behavior they might want, but at the possible expense of performance. As part of the Julia language project, we have developed an approach that yields a novel trade-off between flexibility and compile-time analysis. The core abstraction we use is multiple dispatch. We have come to believe that while multiple dispatch has not been especially popular in most kinds of programming, technical computing is its killer application. By expressing key functions such as array indexing using multi-method signatures, a surprising range of behaviors can be obtained, in a way that is both relatively easy to write and amenable to compiler analysis. The compact factoring of concerns provided by these methods makes it easier for user-defined types to behave consistently with types in the standard library.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Shah, Alan Edelman (2012), <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5145" class="uri">http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.5145</a><p><blockquote><em>Abstract:</em> Dynamic languages have become popular for scientific computing. They are generally considered highly productive, but lacking in performance. This paper presents Julia, a new dynamic language for technical computing, designed for performance from the beginning by adapting and extending modern programming language techniques. A design based on generic functions and a rich type system simultaneously enables an expressive programming model and successful type inference, leading to good performance for a wide range of programs. This makes it possible for much of the Julia library to be written in Julia itself, while also incorporating best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Convex translates problems from a user-friendly functional language into an abstract syntax tree describing the problem. This concise representation of the global structure of the problem allows Convex to infer whether the problem complies with the rules of disciplined convex programming (DCP), and to pass the problem to a suitable solver. These operations are carried out in Julia using multiple dispatch, which dramatically reduces the time required to verify DCP compliance and to parse a problem into conic form. Convex then automatically chooses an appropriate backend solver to solve the conic form problem.</blockquote></p></span></p>

This paper explores how Julia, a modern programming language for numerical computing which claims to bridge this divide by incorporating recent advances in language and compiler design (such as just-in-time compilation), can be used for implementing software and algorithms fundamental to the field of operations research, with a focus on mathematical optimization. In particular, we demonstrate algebraic modeling for linear and nonlinear optimization and a partial implementation of a practical simplex code. Extensive cross-language benchmarks suggest that Julia is capable of obtaining state-of-the-art performance.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Alex Townsend, Sheehan Olver (2014), <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2789" class="uri">http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2789</a><p><blockquote><em>Abstract:</em> A spectral method for solving linear partial differential equations (PDEs) with variable coefficients and general boundary conditions defined on rectangular domains is described, based on separable representations of partial differential operators and the one-dimensional ultraspherical spectral method. If a partial differential operator is of splitting rank 2, such as the operator associated with Poisson or Helmholtz, the corresponding PDE is solved via a generalized Sylvester matrix equation, and a bivariate polynomial approximation of the solution of degree (n<sub>x</sub>,n<sub>y</sub>) is computed in O(n<sub>x</sub> n<sub>y</sub>)<sup>3/2</sup> operations. Partial differential operators of splitting rank &gt;=3 are solved via a linear system involving a block-banded matrix in O(min(n<sub>x</sub><sup>3</sup> n<sub>y</sub>,n<sub>x</sub> n<sub>y</sub><sup>3</sup>)) operations. Numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of our 2D spectral method to a broad class of PDEs, which includes elliptic and dispersive time-evolution equations.

The framework contains a data structure on which row operations can be performed, allowing for the solution of linear equations by the adaptive QR approach. The algorithm achieves O(nopt) complexity, where nopt is the number of degrees of freedom required to achieve a desired accuracy, which is determined adaptively. In addition, special tensor product equations, such as partial differential equations on rectangles, can be solved by truncating the operator in the y-direction with n<sub>y</sub> degrees of freedom and using a generalized Schur decomposition to upper triangularize, before applying the adaptive QR approach to the x-direction, requiring O(n<sup>2</sup><sub>y</sub> n<sup>opt</sup><sub>x</sub>) operations. The framework is implemented in the ApproxFun package written in the Julia programming language, which achieves highly competitive computational costs by exploiting unique features of Julia.</blockquote></p></span></p>

The algorithm is based on Newton’s method with carefully selected initial guesses for the nodes and a fast evaluation scheme for the associated orthogonal polynomial. In the Gauss-Hermite case the initial guesses and evaluation scheme rely on explicit asymptotic formulas. For generalized Gauss-Hermite, the initial guesses are furnished by sampling a certain equilibrium measure and the associated polynomial evaluated via a Riemann-Hilbert reformulation. In both cases the n-point quadrature rule is computed in O(n) operations to an accuracy that is close to machine precision. For sufficiently large n, some of the quadrature weights have a value less than the smallest positive normalized floating-point number in double precision and we exploit this fact to achieve a complexity as low as O(sqrt(n))).</blockquote></p></span></p>

Multiscale problems are problems where the coefficients of a PDE oscillate rapidly on a microscopic length scale, but solutions are sought on a much larger, macroscopic domain. Solving multiscale problems requires both a theoretic result, i.e., a homogenization result yielding effective coefficients, as well as numerical solutions of the PDE at the microscopic and the macroscopic length scales.Numerical homogenization of PDEs with stochastic coefficients is especially computationally expensive. Under certain assumptions, effective coefficients can be found, but their calculation involves subtle numerical problems. The computational cost is huge due to the generally large number of stochastic dimensions.Multiscale problems arise in many applications, e.g., in uncertainty quantification, in the rational design of nanoscale sensors, and in the rational design of materials.Our code for the numerical stochastic homogenization of elliptic problems is implemented in Julia. Since multiscale problems pose new numerical problems, it is in any case necessary to develop new numerical codes. Julia is a dynamic language inspired by the Lisp family of languages, it is open-source, and it provides native-code compilation, access to highly optimized linear-algebra routines, support for parallel computing, and a powerful macro system. We describe our experience in using Julia and discuss the advantages of Julia’s features in this problem domain.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Here, we extend the idea of PCA to handle arbitrary data sets consisting of numerical, Boolean, categorical, ordinal, and other data types. This framework encompasses many well known techniques in data analysis, such as nonnegative matrix factorization, matrix completion, sparse and robust PCA, k-means, k-SVD, and maximum margin matrix factorization. The method handles heterogeneous data sets, and leads to coherent schemes for compressing, denoising, and imputing missing entries across all data types simultaneously. It also admits a number of interesting interpretations of the low rank factors, which allow clustering of examples or of features. We propose several parallel algorithms for fitting generalized low rank models, and describe implementations and numerical results.</blockquote></p></span></p>

Frank van der Meulen, Moritz Schauer (2014), <a href="https://github.com/mschauer/ChemicalLangevin.jl" class="uri">https://github.com/mschauer/ChemicalLangevin.jl</a><p><blockquote><em>Abstract:</em> Bayesian estimation of parameters of a diffusion based on discrete time observations poses a difficult problem due to the lack of a closed form expression for the likelihood. Data-augmentation has been proposed for obtaining draws from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Within this approach, the discrete time observations are augmented with diffusion bridges connecting these observations. This poses two challenges: (i) efficiently generating diffusion bridges; (ii) if unknown parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, then direct implementation of data-augmentation results in an induced Markov chain which is reducible. In this paper we show how both challenges can be addressed in continuous time (before discretisation) by using guided proposals. These are Markov processes with dynamics described by the stochastic differential equation of the diffusion process with an additional term added to the drift coefficient to guide the process to hit the right end point of the bridge. The form of these proposals naturally provides a mapping that decouples the dependence between the diffusion coefficient and diffusion bridge using the driving Brownian motion of the proposals. As the guiding term has a singularity at the right end point, care is needed when discretisation is applied for implementation purposes. We show that this problem can be dealt with by appropriately time changing and scaling of the guided proposal process. In two examples we illustrate the performance of the algorithms we propose. The second of these concerns a diffusion approximation of a chemical reaction network with a four-dimensional diffusion driven by an eight-dimensional Brownian motion.</blockquote></p></span></p>

We propose an annealed importance sampling procedure for estimating expectations with respect to the posterior. The proposed algorithm is useful in cases where finding a good proposal density is challenging, and when estimates of the marginal likelihood are required. The effect of likelihood estimation is investigated, and the results provide guidelines on how to set up the precision of the likelihood estimation in order to optimally implement the procedure. The methodological results are empirically demonstrated in several simulated and real data examples.</blockquote></p></span></p>

We propose a stochastic algorithm for collapsed variational Bayesian inference for LDA, which is simpler and more efficient than the state of the art method.

Starting with a given prior, our method recursively transforms it into an approximate posterior through sequential variational approximation. In this process, new components will be incorporated on the fly when needed.
