      <description>Overdeepenings are a hallmark glacial landform of broad geomorphologlogical and glaciological interest. Their formation mechanism has not yet been fully uncovered, but subglacial drainage is likely a key factor. One prominent hypothesis states that the depth of an overdeepening stabilizes at the supercooling threshold. This threshold is reached when the adverse bed slope terminating an overdeepening is sufficiently large to shut down the efficient, channelized drainage system. Classic theory puts this threshold at a ratio of bed to surface slope of − 1.</description>

      <description>To add a publication to the website, create a markdown file with YAML frontmatter in this directory. By convention, the file is named according to the author initials + year, e.g. _publications/ABC17.md.
The frontmatter is sort of a YAML version of bibtex (but using unicode instead of TeX).
The following fields are required: - title: the name of the paper - authors: the list of the authors. Note that this should be a YAML list, not &amp;ldquo;and&amp;rdquo; separated like bibtex - year</description>

      <description>We solve the stochastic neoclassical growth model, the workhorse of modern macroeconomics, using C++11, Fortran 2008, Java, Julia, Python, Matlab, Mathematica, and R. We implement the same algorithm, value function iteration with grid search, in each of the languages. We report the execution times of the codes in a Mac and in a Windows computer and brieáy comment on the strengths and weaknesses of each language.</description>

      <description>We present a method for Monte Carlo sampling on systems with discrete variables (focusing in the Ising case), introducing a prior on the candidate moves in a Metropolis–Hastings scheme which can significantly reduce the rejection rate, called the reduced-rejection-rate (RRR) method. The method employs same probability distribution for the choice of the moves as rejection-free schemes such as the method proposed by Bortz, Kalos and Lebowitz (BKL) (1975 J. Comput.

      <description>This note explains how MPI may be used with the Julia programming language. An example of a simple Monte Carlo study is presented, with code. The code is intended to serve as a general purpose template for more relevant applications. A second example shows how the template code may be adapted to perform a Monte Carlo study of the properties of an approximate Bayesian computing estimator of actual research interest. All of the code is available at https://github.</description>

      <title>A practical framework for infinite-dimensional linear algebra</title>

      <description>We describe a framework for solving a broad class of infinite-dimensional linear equations, consisting of almost banded operators, which can be used to represent linear ordinary differential equations with general boundary conditions. The framework contains a data structure on which row operations can be performed, allowing for the solution of linear equations by the adaptive QR approach. The algorithm achieves O(nopt) complexity, where nopt is the number of degrees of freedom required to achieve a desired accuracy, which is determined adaptively.</description>

      <title>A two-step linear programming model for energy-efficient timetables in metro railway networks</title>
      <link>julialang.org/research/dtp16/</link>

      <guid>julialang.org/research/dtp16/</guid>
      <description>In this paper we propose a novel two-step linear optimization model to calculate energy-efficient timetables in metro railway networks. The resultant timetable minimizes the total energy consumed by all trains and maximizes the utilization of regenerative energy produced by braking trains, subject to the constraints in the railway network. In contrast to other existing models, which are NP-hard, our model is computationally the most tractable one being a linear program. We apply our optimization model to different instances of service PES2-SFM2 of line 8 of Shanghai Metro network spanning a full service period of one day (18 h) with thousands of active trains.</description>

      <title>Accurate eigenvalue decomposition of real symmetric arrowhead matrices and applications</title>

      <description>We present a new algorithm for solving the eigenvalue problem for an n × n real symmetric arrowhead matrix. The algorithm computes all eigenvalues and all components of the corresponding eigenvectors with high relative accuracy in O(n^2) operations under certain circumstances. The algorithm is based on a shift-and-invert approach. Only a single element of the inverse of the shifted matrix eventually needs to be computed with double the working precision. Each eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector can be computed separately, which makes the algorithm adaptable for parallel computing.</description>

      <title>Adaptive methods for stochastic differential equations via natural embeddings and rejection sampling with memory</title>

      <description>Adaptive time-stepping with high-order embedded Runge-Kutta pairs and rejection sampling provides efficient approaches for solving differential equations. While many such methods exist for solving deterministic systems, little progress has been made for stochastic variants. One challenge in developing adaptive methods for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is the construction of embedded schemes with direct error estimates. We present a new class of embedded stochastic Runge-Kutta (SRK) methods with strong order 1.5 which have a natural embedding of strong order 1.</description>

      <description>Assuming a steady-state condition within a cell, metabolic fluxes satisfy an underdetermined linear system of stoichiometric equations. Characterizing the space of fluxes that satisfy such equations along with given bounds (and possibly additional relevant constraints) is con- sidered of utmost importance for the understanding of cellular metabolism. Extreme values for each individual flux can be computed with linear programming (as flux balance analysis), and their marginal distributions can be approximately computed with Monte Carlo sampling.</description>

      <description>Master/Worker distributed programming model enables huge remote sensing data processing by assigning tasks to Workers in which data is stored. Cloud computing features include the deployment of Workers by using virtualized technologies such as virtual machines and containers. These features allow programmers to configure, create, and start virtual resources for instance. In order to develop remote sensing applications by taking advantage of high-level programming languages (e.g., R, Matlab, and Julia), users have to manually address Cloud resource deployment.</description>

      <title>Annealed Important Sampling for Models with Latent Variables</title>

      <description>This paper is concerned with Bayesian inference when the likelihood is analytically intractable but can be unbiasedly estimated. We propose an annealed importance sampling procedure for estimating expectations with respect to the posterior. The proposed algorithm is useful in cases where finding a good proposal density is challenging, and when estimates of the marginal likelihood are required. The effect of likelihood estimation is investigated, and the results provide guidelines on how to set up the precision of the likelihood estimation in order to optimally implement the procedure.</description>

      <description>We present an approximate Bayesian computation scheme for estimating number concentrations of monodisperse diffusing nanoparticles in suspension by optical particle tracking microscopy. The method is based on the probability distribution of the time spent by a particle inside a detection region. We validate the method on suspensions of well-controlled reference particles. We illustrate its usefulness with an application in gene therapy, applying the method to estimate number concentrations of plasmid DNA molecules and the average number of DNA molecules complexed with liposomal drug delivery particles.</description>

      <description>Arrays are such a rich and fundamental data type that they tend to be built into a language, either in the compiler or in a large low-level library. Defining this functionality at the user level instead provides greater flexibility for application domains not envisioned by the language designer. Only a few languages, such as C++ and Haskell, provide the necessary power to define n-dimensional arrays, but these systems rely on compile-time abstraction, sacrificing some flexibility.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Parking Using Optimization-Based Collision Avoidance</title>

      <guid>julialang.org/research/zaaf18/</guid>
      <description>We present an optimization-based approach for autonomous parking. Building on recent advances in the area of optimization-based collision avoidance (OBCA), we show that the autonomous parking problem can be formulated as a smooth non-convex optimization problem. Unfortunately, such problems are numerically challenging to solve in general and require appropriate warm-starting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm called Hierarchical OBCA (H-OBCA). The main idea is to first use a generic path planner, such as Hybrid A, to compute a coarse trajectory using a simplified vehicle model and by discretizing the state-input space.</description>

      <description>Bayesian estimation of parameters of a diffusion based on discrete time observations poses a difficult problem due to the lack of a closed form expression for the likelihood. Data-augmentation has been proposed for obtaining draws from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Within this approach, the discrete time observations are augmented with diffusion bridges connecting these observations. This poses two challenges: (i) efficiently generating diffusion bridges; (ii) if unknown parameters appear in the diffusion coefficient, then direct implementation of data-augmentation results in an induced Markov chain which is reducible.</description>

      <description>Broyden&amp;rsquo;s method is a general method commonly used for nonlinear systems of equations when very little information is available about the problem. We develop an approach based on Broyden&amp;rsquo;s method for the structure appearing in nonlinear eigenvalue problems. Our approach is designed for problems where the evaluation of a matrix vector product is computationally expensive, essentially as expensive as solving the corresponding linear system of equations. We show how the structure of the Jacobian matrix can be incorporated into the algorithm to improve convergence.</description>

      <description>Scientific algorithms are designed and implemented in a variety of programming languages. Depending on the exact application, some languages are a better choice than others: some offer a productive environment while others focus on performance. Selecting a language is often difficult, with poor choices resulting in much higher development times.
By implementing a case study algorithm in multiple programming languages, we compare their pros and cons. As a case study, we selected the trace transform, an image processing algorithm from the widely used class of integral transforms.</description>

      <description>Background: Establishing health-related causal relationships is a central pursuit in biomedical research. Yet, the interdependent non-linearity of biological systems renders causal dynamics laborious and at times impractical to disentangle. This pursuit is further impeded by the dearth of time series that are sufficiently long to observe and understand recurrent patterns of flux. However, as data generation costs plummet and technologies like wearable devices democratize data collection, we anticipate a coming surge in the availability of biomedically-relevant time series data.</description>

With this background, we propose CellFishing.jl, a new method for searching atlas-scale datasets for similar cells and detecting noteworthy genes of query cells with high accuracy and throughput. Using multiple scRNA-seq datasets, we validate that our method demonstrates comparable accuracy to and is markedly faster than the state-of-the-art software.</description>

We provide a method to determine the steady states of this system that is tractable for metabolic networks of arbitrary complexity.</description>

      <description>Security managers face the challenge of formulating and implementing policies that deliver their desired system security postures — for example, their preferred balance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability — within budget (monetary and otherwise). In this paper, we describe a security modelling methodology, grounded in rigorous mathematical systems modelling and economics, that captures the managers’ policies and the behavioural choices of agents operating within the system. Models are executable, so allowing systematic experimental exploration of the system-policy co-design space, and compositional, so managing the complexity of large-scale systems.</description>

      <description>We explore computational high-throughput screening as a design strategy for heterogeneous, isotropic fiber materials. Fluid permeability, a key property in the design of soft porous materials, is systematically studied using a multi-scale lattice Boltzmann framework. After characterizing microscopic permeability as a function of solid volume fraction in the microstructure, we perform high-throughput computational screening of in excess of 35 000 macrostructures consisting of a continuous bulk interrupted by spherical/elliptical domains with either lower or higher microscopic permeability (hence with two distinct microscopic solid volume fractions and therefore two distinct microscopic permeabilities) to assess which parameters determine macroscopic permeability for a fixed average solid volume fraction.</description>

      <description>Motivated by the substantial interest in various fillers to enhance the barrier properties of polymeric films, especially graphene derivatives, we perform a computational screening of obstructed diffusion to explore the design parameter space of nanoplatelet-filled composites synthesized in silico. As a model for the nanoplatelets, we use circular and elliptical nonoverlapping and impermeable flat disks, and diffusion is stochastically simulated using a random-walk model, from which the effective diffusivity is calculated.</description>

      <description>A quantum anharmonic oscillator is defined by the Hamiltonian H, where the potential is given by V. Using the Sinc collocation method combined with the double exponential transformation, we develop a method to efficiently compute highly accurate approximations of energy eigenvalues for anharmonic oscillators. Convergence properties of the proposed method are presented. Using the principle of minimal sensitivity, we introduce an alternate expression for the mesh size for the Sinc collocation method which improves considerably the accuracy in computing eigenvalues for potentials with multiple wells.</description>

      <description>The state of numerical computing is currently characterized by a divide between highly efficient yet typically cumbersome low-level languages such as C, C++, and Fortran and highly expressive yet typically slow high-level languages such as Python and MATLAB. This paper explores how Julia, a modern programming language for numerical computing which claims to bridge this divide by incorporating recent advances in language and compiler design (such as just-in-time compilation), can be used for implementing software and algorithms fundamental to the field of operations research, with a focus on mathematical optimization.</description>

      <description>This paper describes Convex, a convex optimization modeling framework in Julia. Convex translates problems from a user-friendly functional language into an abstract syntax tree describing the problem. This concise representation of the global structure of the problem allows Convex to infer whether the problem complies with the rules of disciplined convex programming (DCP), and to pass the problem to a suitable solver. These operations are carried out in Julia using multiple dispatch, which dramatically reduces the time required to verify DCP compliance and to parse a problem into conic form.</description>

      <description>Due to the increasing availability of large data sets, the need for general-purpose massively-parallel analysis tools become ever greater. In unsupervised learning, Bayesian nonparametric mixture models, exemplified by the DirichletProcess Mixture Model (DPMM), provide a principled Bayesian approach to adapt model complexity to the data. Despite their potential, however, DPMMs have yet to become a popular tool. This is partly due to the lack of friendly software tools that can handle large datasets efficiently.</description>

      <description>We perform simulations of obstructed diffusion in periodic lattice configurations of solid, nonoverlapping, impermeable superballs to study effective diffusivity as a function of shape and solid volume fraction for simple cubic (sc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and face-centered cubic (fcc) lattices. In the simulations, point particles diffuse in the intermediate space between the solid superballs. For sc lattices, we find that for a constant solid volume fraction, the optimal effective diffusivity is obtained for a particular superball between a sphere and a cube, whereas for bcc and fcc lattices, no such optimum exists.</description>

      <description>GPUs and other accelerators are popular devices for accelerating compute-intensive, parallelizable applications. However, programming these devices is a difficult task. Writing efficient device code is challenging, and is typically done in a low-level programming language. High-level languages are rarely supported, or do not integrate with the rest of the high-level language ecosystem. To overcome this, we propose compiler infrastructure to efficiently add support for new hardware or environments to an existing programming language.</description>

      <description>Directional variograms were introduced in geostatistics as a tool for revealing major directions of correlation in spatial data. However, their estimation presents some practical challenges, particularly in the case of large irregularly-sampled data sets where efficient spectral-based estimation methods are not applicable. In this work, we propose a generalization of directional variograms to general partitions of spatial data, and introduce a parallel estimation algorithm that can efficiently handle large data sets with more than 10^5 points.</description>

      <description>Julia is a young programming language that is designed for technical computing. Although Julia is dynamically typed it is very fast and usually yields C speed by utilizing a just-in-time compiler. Still, Julia has a simple syntax that is similar to Matlab, which is widely known as an easy-to-use programming environment. While Julia is very versatile and provides asynchronous programming facilities in the form of tasks (coroutines) as well as distributed multi-process parallelism, one missing feature is shared memory multi-threading.</description>

      <description>In the course of evolution, proteins show a remarkable conservation of their three-dimensional structure and their biological function, leading to strong evolutionary constraints on the sequence variability between homologous proteins. Our method aims at extracting such constraints from rapidly accumulating sequence data, and thereby at inferring protein structure and function from sequence information alone. Recently, global statistical inference methods (e.g. direct-coupling analysis, sparse inverse covariance estimation) have achieved a breakthrough towards this aim, and their predictions have been successfully implemented into tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction methods.</description>

      <description>A fast and accurate algorithm for the computation of Gauss-Hermite and generalized Gauss-Hermite quadrature nodes and weights is presented. The algorithm is based on Newton&amp;rsquo;s method with carefully selected initial guesses for the nodes and a fast evaluation scheme for the associated orthogonal polynomial. In the Gauss-Hermite case the initial guesses and evaluation scheme rely on explicit asymptotic formulas. For generalized Gauss-Hermite, the initial guesses are furnished by sampling a certain equilibrium measure and the associated polynomial evaluated via a Riemann-Hilbert reformulation.</description>

      <description>As showed in (Fiedler, 1990), any polynomial can be expressed as a characteristic polynomial of a complex symmetric arrowhead matrix. This expression is not unique. If the polynomial is real with only real distinct roots, the matrix can be chosen real. By using accurate forward stable algorithm for computing eigenvalues of real symmetric arrowhead matrices from (Jakovcevic Stor, Slapnicar, Barlow, 2015), we derive a forward stable algorithm for computation of roots of such polynomials in O(n2) operations.</description>

The algorithm computes each eigenvalue and all components of the corresponding eigenvector with high relative accuracy in O(n) operations. The algorithm is based on a shift-and-invert approach. Only a single element of the inverse of the shifted matrix eventually needs to be computed with double the working precision.</description>

Several different pseudo-potential models are used to obtain varying degrees of microstructural heterogeneity. Systematically varying solid volume fraction and degree of heterogeneity, virtual screening of more than 10,000 material structures is performed, simulating fluid flow using a lattice Boltzmann framework and computing the permeability. We develop a well-performing functional regression model for permeability prediction based on using isotropic two-point correlation functions as microstructural descriptors.</description>

To overcome this, we present a framework for CUDA GPU programming in the high-level Julia programming language. This framework compiles Julia source code for GPU execution, and takes care of the necessary low-level interactions using modern code generation techniques to avoid run-time overhead.</description>

In the quantum context, Green&amp;rsquo;s functions are correlation functions, from which it is possible to extract information from the system under study, such as the density of states, relaxation times and response functions. Despite its power and versatility, it is known as a laborious and sometimes cumbersome method. Here we introduce the equilibrium Green&amp;rsquo;s functions and the equation-of-motion technique, exemplifying the method in discrete lattices of non-interacting electrons.</description>

      <description>We discuss the advantages of using Julia for solving multiscale problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). Multiscale problems are problems where the coefficients of a PDE oscillate rapidly on a microscopic length scale, but solutions are sought on a much larger, macroscopic domain. Solving multiscale problems requires both a theoretic result, i.e., a homogenization result yielding effective coefficients, as well as numerical solutions of the PDE at the microscopic and the macroscopic length scales.</description>

      <description>We present JuliaReach, a toolbox for set-based reachability analysis of dynamical systems. JuliaReach consists of two main packages: Reachability, containing implementations of reachability algorithms for continuous and hybrid systems, and LazySets, a standalone library that implements state-of-the-art algorithms for calculus with convex sets. The library offers both concrete and lazy set representations, where the latter stands for the ability to delay set computations until they are needed. The choice of the programming language Julia and the accompanying documentation of our toolbox allow researchers to easily translate set-based algorithms from mathematics to software in a platform-independent way, while achieving runtime performance that is comparable to statically compiled languages.</description>

Automated discovery of interesting patterns that are present in the data can help to generate new biological hypotheses. Results: We introduce Kpax3, a Bayesian method for bi-clustering multiple sequence alignments. Influence of individual sites will be determined in a supervised manner by using informative prior distributions for the model parameters.</description>

      <description>An architecture for interactive, notebook-based ns-3 simulations in the cloud is proposed. A prototype implementation of an example study for IEEE 802.11p inter-channel interference is developed as a test-case, using direct integration of ns-3 components with Jupyter via Julia&amp;rsquo;s C++ support. This shows that flexible animations with advanced visualization of live ns-3 simulation results can be setup quickly. Although the system appears complex, the benefits of ns-3 as fast and flexible discrete event simulator complement Julia&amp;rsquo;s scalability in numerical computing and Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s versatility on the Web and provide supporting evidence of LiveSim as a promising direction for multi-modal, reproducible network research.</description>

      <description>We implement a massively parallel population Monte Carlo approximate Bayesian computation (PMC‐ABC) method for estimating diffusion coefficients, sizes and concentrations of diffusing nanoparticles in liquid suspension using confocal laser scanning microscopy and particle tracking. The method is based on the joint probability distribution of diffusion coefficients and the time spent by a particle inside a detection region where particles are tracked. We present freely available central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) versions of the analysis software, and we apply the method to characterize mono‐ and bidisperse samples of fluorescent polystyrene beads.</description>

      <description>Matrix Depot is a Julia software package that provides easy access to a large and diverse collection of test matrices. Its novelty is threefold. First, it is extensible by the user, and so can be adapted to include the user’s own test problems. In doing so it facilitates experimentation and makes it easier to carry out reproducible research. Second, it amalgamates in a single framework three different types of matrix collections, comprising parametrized test matrices, regularization test problems, and real-life sparse matrix data.</description>

      <title>Mean-Independent Noise Control of Cell Fates via Intermediate States</title>

      <description>Stochasticity affects accurate signal detection and robust generation of correct cell fates. Although many known regulatory mechanisms may reduce fluctuations in signals, most simultaneously influence their mean dynamics, leading to unfaithful cell fates. Through analysis and computation, we demonstrate that a reversible signaling mechanism acting through intermediate states can reduce noise while maintaining the mean. This mean-independent noise control (MINC) mechanism is investigated in the context of an intracellular binding protein that regulates retinoic acid (RA) signaling during zebrafish hindbrain development.</description>

      <description>We introduce an in silico model for the initial spread of an aberrant phenotype with Warburg-like overflow metabolism within a healthy homeostatic tissue in contact with a nutrient reservoir (the blood), aimed at characterizing the role of the microenvironment for aberrant growth. Accounting for cellular metabolic activity, competition for nutrients, spatial diffusion and their feedbacks on aberrant replication and death rates, we obtain a phase portrait where distinct asymptotic whole-tissue states are found upon varying the tissue-blood turnover rate and the level of blood-borne primary nutrient.</description>

      <description>Motivation: MIToS is an environment for mutual information analysis and a framework for protein multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and protein structures (PDB) management in Julia language. It integrates sequence and structural information through SIFTS, making Pfam MSAs analysis straightforward. MIToS streamlines the implementation of any measure calculated from residue contingency tables and its optimization and testing in terms of protein contact prediction. As an example, we implemented and tested a BLOSUM62-based pseudo-count strategy in mutual information analysis.</description>

      <description>A kinetic Monte Carlo model of a reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process is presented. The algorithm has been developed and implemented in Julia for the three main RAFT theories under current discussion (slow fragmentation, intermediate radical termination, and intermediate radical termination with oligomers). Julia is a modern programming language designed to achieve high performance in numerical and scientific computing. Thanks to a careful optimization of the code, it is possible to simulate a RAFT reaction scheme in short computing times for any of the three theories.</description>

      <guid>julialang.org/research/clldnr17/</guid>
      <description>The Adam and Gibbs theory depicts the viscous flow of silicate melts as governed by the cooperative re-arrangement of molecular sub-systems. Considering that such subsystems involve the silicate Qn units (n = number of bridging oxygens), this study presents a model that links the Qn unit fractions to the melt configurational entropy at the glass transition temperature Tg, Sconf(Tg), and finally, to its viscosity η. With 13 adjustable parameters, the model reproduces η and Tg of melts in the Na2O-K2O-SiO2 system (60 ≤ [SiO2] ≤ 100 mol%) with 1σ standard deviations of 0.</description>

      <description>Many Earth‐surface processes are studied using field, experimental, or numerical modeling datasets that represent a small subset of possible outcomes observed in nature. Based on these data, deterministic models can be built that describe the average evolution of a system. However, these models commonly cannot account for the complex variability of many processes or present a quantitative statement of uncertainty. To assess such uncertainty, stochastic models are needed that can mimic spatial as well as temporal variability.</description>

      <description>We introduce two new packages, Nemo and Hecke, written in the Julia programming language for computer algebra and number theory. We demonstrate that high performance generic algorithms can be implemented in Julia, without the need to resort to a low-level C implementation. For specialised algorithms, we use Julia&amp;rsquo;s efficient native C interface to wrap existing C/C++ libraries such as Flint, Arb, Antic and Singular. We give examples of how to use Hecke and Nemo and discuss some algorithms that we have implemented to provide high performance basic arithmetic.</description>

      <description>A linear algebraic approach to graph algorithms that exploits the sparse adjacency matrix representation of graphs can provide a variety of benefits. These benefits include syntactic simplicity, easier implementation, and higher performance. One way to employ linear algebra techniques for graph algorithms is to use a broader definition of matrix and vector multiplication. We demonstrate through the use of the Julia language system how easy it is to explore semirings using linear algebraic methodologies.</description>

      <description>We investigate the use of conformal maps for the acceleration of convergence of the trapezoidal rule and Sinc numerical methods. The conformal map is a polynomial adjustment to the sinh map, and allows the treatment of a finite number of singularities in the complex plane. In the case where locations are unknown, the so-called Sinc-Padé approximants are used to provide approximate results. This adaptive method is shown to have almost the same convergence properties.</description>

      <description>Reliance on computationally expensive algorithms for inference has been limiting the use of Bayesian nonparametric models in large scale applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a Bayesian learning algorithm for DP mixture models. Instead of following the conventional paradigm &amp;ndash; random initialization plus iterative update, we take an progressive approach. Starting with a given prior, our method recursively transforms it into an approximate posterior through sequential variational approximation. In this process, new components will be incorporated on the fly when needed.</description>

      <description>We present scalable algebraic modeling software, StochJuMP, for stochastic optimization as applied to power grid economic dispatch. It enables the user to express the problem in a high-level algebraic format with minimal boilerplate. StochJuMP allows efficient parallel model instantiation across nodes and efficient data localization. Computational results are presented showing that the model construction is efficient, requiring less than one percent of solve time. StochJuMP is configured with the parallel interior-point solver PIPS-IPM but is sufficiently generic to allow straight forward adaptation to other solvers.</description>

The ability to reuse a single codebase for all these purposes provides new ways to understand and verify parallel programs.</description>

      <description>Computational scientists often prototype software using productivity languages that offer high-level programming abstractions. When higher performance is needed, they are obliged to rewrite their code in a lower-level efficiency language. Different solutions have been proposed to address this trade-off between productivity and efficiency. One promising approach is to create embedded domain-specific languages that sacrifice generality for productivity and performance, but practical experience with DSLs points to some road blocks preventing widespread adoption.</description>

      <description>This master&amp;rsquo;s thesis explores the possibility to provide access to the computing power of a GPU from the high-level programming language Julia. An important requirement here is to keep the programmer&amp;rsquo;s productivity at the same high level as if he would use Julia without a GPU. Indeed, very specialized and detailed technical knowledge is needed in order to program a GPU, making it complex and time-consuming. In many modern scientific domains quite a lot of brute computing power is required, but often these domains lack the technical expertise to use GPUs in an efficient manner.</description>

      <description>POMDPs.jl is an open-source framework for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). POMDPs.jl allows users to specify sequential decision making problems with minimal effort without sacrificing the expressive nature of POMDPs, making this framework viable for both educational and research purposes. It is written in the Julia language to allow flexible prototyping and large-scale computation that leverages the high-performance nature of the language. The associated JuliaPOMDP community also provides a number of state-of-the-art MDP and POMDP solvers and a rich library of support tools to help with implementing new solvers and evaluating the solution results.</description>

      <description>The related concepts of protein dynamics, conformational ensembles and allostery are often difficult to study with molecular dynamics (MD) due to the timescales involved. We present ExProSE (Exploration of Protein Structural Ensembles), a distance geometry-based method that generates an ensemble of protein structures from two input structures. ExProSE provides a unified framework for the exploration of protein structure and dynamics in a fast and accessible way. Using a dataset of apo/holo pairs it is shown that existing coarse-grained methods often cannot span large conformational changes.</description>

      <description>Reachability analysis aims at identifying states reachable by a system within a given time horizon. This task is known to be computationally hard for hybrid systems. One of the main challenges is the handling of discrete transitions, including computation of intersections with invariants and guards. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a state-space decomposition approach for linear hybrid systems. This approach allows us to perform most operations in low-dimensional state space, which can lead to significant performance improvements.</description>

      <description>The Hadamard product features prominently in tensor-based algorithms in scientific computing and data analysis. Due to its tendency to significantly increase ranks, the Hadamard product can represent a major computational obstacle in algorithms based on low-rank tensor representations. It is therefore of interest to develop recompression techniques that mitigate the effects of this rank increase. In this work, we investigate such techniques for the case of the Tucker format, which is well suited for tensors of low order and small to moderate multilinear ranks.</description>

      <description>Switching time optimization arises in finite-horizon optimal control for switched systems where, given a sequence of continuous dynamics, one minimizes a cost function with respect to the switching times. We propose an efficient method for computing the optimal switching times for switched linear and nonlinear systems. A novel second-order optimization algorithm is introduced where, at each iteration, the dynamics are linearized over an underlying time grid to compute the cost function, the gradient and the Hessian efficiently.</description>

Computational tools exploiting rapidly growing genomic databases to characterize protein−protein interactions are urgently needed. Such methods should connect multiple scales from evolutionary conserved interactions between families of homologous proteins, over the identification of specifically interacting proteins in the case of multiple paralogs inside a species, down to the prediction of residues being in physical contact across interaction interfaces.</description>

      <description>This paper addresses a well-known problem that occurs when memories are exposed to radiation: the determination if a bit flip is isolated or if it belongs to a multiple event. As it is unusual to know the physical layout of the memory, this paper proposes to evaluate the statistical properties of the sets of corrupted addresses and to compare the results with a mathematical prediction model where all of the events are single bit upsets.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Collapsed Variational Bayesian Inference for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</title>

      <description>There has been an explosion in the amount of digital text information available in recent years, leading to challenges of scale for traditional inference algorithms for topic models. Recent advances in stochastic variational inference algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) have made it feasible to learn topic models on very large-scale corpora, but these methods do not currently take full advantage of the collapsed representation of the model. We propose a stochastic algorithm for collapsed variational Bayesian inference for LDA, which is simpler and more efficient than the state of the art method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Simulation by Image Quilting of Process-based Geological Models</title>

      <description>Process-based modeling offers a way to represent realistic geological heterogeneity in subsurface models. The main limitation lies in conditioning such models to data. Multiple-point geostatistics can use these process-based models as training images and address the data conditioning problem. In this work, we further develop image quilting as a method for 3D stochastic simulation capable of mimicking the realism of process-based geological models with minimal modeling effort (i.e. parameter tuning) and at the same time condition them to a variety of data.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Manipulation of Flows of Nonlinear Evolution Equations, with Application in the Analysis of Split-Step Time Integrators</title>

      <description>We describe a package realized in the Julia programming language which performs symbolic manipulations applied to nonlinear evolution equations, their flows, and commutators of such objects. This tool was employed to perform contrived computations arising in the analysis of the local error of operator splitting methods. It enabled the proof of the convergence of the basic method and of the asymptotical correctness of a defect-based error estimator. The performance of our package is illustrated on several examples.</description>

      <title>The automatic solution of partial differential equations using a global spectral method</title>

      <description>A spectral method for solving linear partial differential equations (PDEs) with variable coefficients and general boundary conditions defined on rectangular domains is described, based on separable representations of partial differential operators and the one-dimensional ultraspherical spectral method. If a partial differential operator is of splitting rank 2, such as the operator associated with Poisson or Helmholtz, the corresponding PDE is solved via a generalized Sylvester matrix equation, and a bivariate polynomial approximation of the solution of degree (n_x,n_y) is computed in O(n_x n_y)^{3&amp;frasl;2} operations.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Property and Fluid Modeling with Modern Programming Language Constructs</title>

      <description>Modelica is used extensively to model thermo-fluid pipe networks. Experience shows that Modelica models in this domain have limitations due to missing functional expressiveness of the Modelica language. In this paper, a prototype is described that demonstrates how thermodynamic property and thermo-fluid pipe component modeling could be considerably enhanced via modern language constructs available in Julia. This prototype is based on the Modia modelling and simulation prototype and relies on features of the Julia programming language.</description>

      <title>Unreasonable effectiveness of learning neural networks: From accessible states and robust ensembles to basic algorithmic schemes</title>

      <description>In artificial neural networks, learning from data is a computationally demanding task in which a large number of connection weights are iteratively tuned through stochastic-gradient-based heuristic processes over a cost function. It is not well understood how learning occurs in these systems, in particular how they avoid getting trapped in configurations with poor computational performance. Here, we study the difficult case of networks with discrete weights, where the optimization landscape is very rough even for simple architectures, and provide theoretical and numerical evidence of the existence of rare—but extremely dense and accessible—regions of configurations in the network weight space.</description>
