# Current Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives

The Julia Language community is always working on ways we can systematically promote diversity and inclusion. Here are some active projects we are working on in that vain:

- Translation of Julia materials into Spanish [1](https://github.com/JuliaEs), [2](https://github.com/JuliaIntro/IntroAJulia.jl)
- Improving the guidance around moderation on Discourse
- [Actively recruiting folks from underrepresented communities to learn Julia](https://twitter.com/juliainclusive)
- Ensuring the first time contributor experience is smooth
- Technical and career mentoring for underrepresented groups in computing
