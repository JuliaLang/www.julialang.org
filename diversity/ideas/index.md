# Ideas to promote Diversity and Inclusion

The current team working on D&I are hyper focused on ensuring our current projects have a measurable impact. This means that we cannot work on everything at the same time. While there are some great ideas presented here, we ultimately have to pick and choose what we think strategically will move the needle in the short and long term for the Julia Language Community given our constrained resources.

If you are interested in helping out or leading any of the below initiatives, please free to send and email to `diversity@julialang.org` or drop by the [#diversity channel on Slack](http://julialang.org/slack/).
