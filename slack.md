# The Julia Language Slack

The Julia Language has an active Slack workspace/community with over 8,000 members. Slack is a space to have quick and informal correspondence with others in the community. We ask that if you have Julia usage questions, you post them on [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org) so others can benefit from them. You could also use Stack Overflow but the Discourse community is much more welcoming (in our opinion).

### Admins
The [Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/) are enforced on Slack by our Slack Admins. 

**If you see or experience any violation of those standards, or feel unsafe or upset, please contact us by sending an email to [slackadmins@julialang.org](mailto:slackadmins@julialang.org).** All communications will be treated confidentially but incidents may be shared the Julia Stewards (who will treat all information confidentially as well).

You can also contact the [Julia Stewards](https://julialang.org/community/stewards/) by emailing [stewards@julialang.org](mailto:stewards@julialang.org), in particular if your concern or conflict involves the admins and/or you would prefer a third party to resolve it.

Slack lacks adequate moderations tools so at the present moment, you will have to [email the moderators](mailto:slackadmins@julialang.org) if you think the Julia Community Standards have been violated or otherwise need the support of an Admin. See [the list of our current Slack Admins](https://julialang.slack.com/account/workspace-settings#admins) (Slack sign-in required)
