# The Julia Language Slack

The Julia Language has an active Slack workspace/community with over 7,000 members. Slack is a space to have quick and informal correspondence with others in the community. We ask that if you have Julia usage questions you post them on [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org) so others can benefit from them or on Stack Overflow (but the Discourse community is much more welcoming in our opinion).
