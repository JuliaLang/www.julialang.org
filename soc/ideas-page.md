# Julia Seasons of Contributions

The Julia Seasons of Contributions (JSoC) are the seasonal programs for funding and/or mentoring students and other developers to contribute to the open source ecosystem. Below are the current programs that the Julia Language is participating in. For any questions, please consult the program administrators at jsoc@julialang.org

## Google Code-In

The Julia organization will be a participant in the 2019 Google Code In program which  runs from December 2019 to January 2020. Participants in this program are high school students aged 13-17, many of whom are new to programming, or to open source. The program consists of small, guided tasks, with help and mentorship available to complete them. Please visit the [Julia project page](https://codein.withgoogle.com/organizations/the-julia-programming-language/) on the Code In site for more information. 


## NumFOCUS Small Development Grants

Semi-quarterly NumFOCUS puts out a call for small development grants. The Julia language organization puts out a call for proposals from the community for grant proposals. There are no restrictions on what the funding can be used for. Code development, documentation work, educational, sustainability, and diversity initiatives, or other types of projects are all eligible. Since only one application can be put in for the Julia project, an internal selection process is used to determine to chose which is the proposals will be submitted to NumFOCUS. For examples of grants that were funded in the first round, [previous awards](https://www.numfocus.org/blog/numfocus-awards-development-grants-to-open-source-projects-spring-2018)

Up to $3,000 is available per proposal. The total allocated funding from NumFOCUS was $20,000 in previous cycles, meaning that not every project will be able to receive a grant. This total amount is adjusted depending on the number and quality of proposals this may be adjusted up or down.

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

The Julia organization is a participant in Google Summer of Code. The Julia organization generally fields a large number of students (>20) mentored by open source developers and university professors at leading institutions from all around the world. Students who are accepted into this prestigious program are paid a summer salary to contribute to the open source tooling around Julia and its package ecosystem.

This page lists a bunch of project ideas, meant to serve as starting points as you develop your own plan. You're free to modify them to your tastes, or propose something totally different in an area you're interested in.

Check out the [application guidelines](guidelines/) once you have a project in mind.

### Projects

We have our project ideas organized roughly into the skillsets required:

* [Turing projects](gsoc/turing.html) for probabilistic modelling and probabilistic programming.
* [Flux projects](https://fluxml.ai/gsoc.html) for machine learning.
* [Compiler](gsoc/compiler.html) – work on the Julia compiler's internals to make things better for everyone.
* [Web Platform](gsoc/wasm.html) – work on the Julia wasm backend or other aspects of julia in the browser.
* [HPC](gsoc/hpc.html) – write code that runs on lots of machines, goes really fast, processes lots of data, or all three.
* [Numerics](gsoc/numerics.html) – Challenges for the hard–core number-cruncher, including linear algebra routines and basic mathematical functions.
* [Science](gsoc/science.html) – provide Julia with the ability for scientific research in various fields.
* [Differential Equations](gsoc/diffeq.html) - Numerical methods for high-performance solving of differential equation models.
* [Tooling](gsoc/tooling.html) – The projects that make the people that make Julia go, go. Help us make a really amazing IDE!
* [Images](gsoc/images.html) – extend Julia's suite of tools for visualization and analysis of images.
* [General](gsoc/general.html) – jack-of-all-trades projects that don't require special skills.
* [Graphs](gsoc/graphs.html) – extend the JuliaGraphs ecosystem with new algorithms and tools.
* [Graphics](gsoc/graphics.html) – projects ranging from low level OpenGL rendering to high level plotting.
* [Tabular Data](gsoc/tables.html)
* [Continuous time signal processing](gsoc/kalmanbucy.html)
