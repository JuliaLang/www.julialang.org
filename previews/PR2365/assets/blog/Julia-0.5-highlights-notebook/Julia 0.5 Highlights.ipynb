Moreover, several of these features set the stage for even more to come in the [lead up to Julia 1.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gXMpbY1kJY). In this post, we’ll go through some of the major changes in 0.5, including improvements to functional programming, comprehensions, generators, arrays, strings, and more.\n",

    "Julia has always had first-class functions that can be passed to and from other functions (i.e. higher-order functions) and full support for lambdas. Before this release, however, anonymous and higher-order functions came with a significant performance cost, and in a language that targets high-performance technical computing, that’s a serious limitation. So the Julia standard library and ecosystem have been rife with work-arounds to get the expressiveness of functional programming without the performance problems. But the right solution, of course, is to make functional programming fast – ideally just as fast as the optimal hand-written version of your code would be. In Julia 0.5, it is. And that changes everything.\n",

This syntax lets you vectorize your scalar functions the way built-in vectorized functions like log, exp, and atan2 work. In fact, in the future, this syntax may replace the pre-vectorized methods of functions like exp and log, so that users will write `exp.(v)` to exponentiate a vector of values. "
