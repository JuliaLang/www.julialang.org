## Julia Packages

The Julia ecosystem contains over 12,000 packages that are registered in the [General registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General), which means that finding the right package can be a challenge. Usually, searching with a package name with a `.jl` extension on a search engine helps find the right page quickly. For example, to search for the Julia dataframes package, [search for dataframes.jl](https://www.google.com/search?q=dataframes.jl&oq=dataframes.jl).

There are services that can help navigate the package ecosystem:

* [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages) — a [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com) service that includes search of all registered open source package documentation, code search, and navigation by tags/keywords.
* [Julia Packages](https://juliapackages.com) — browse Julia packages, filter by categories, and sort them by popularity, creation date or date of last update. Also supports browsing package developers.
* [Julia Package Comparisons](https://juliapackagecomparisons.github.io) - a website to help Julia users discover and choose between packages.

Julia has an official package manager along with its own infrastructure to build binaries and libraries:

* [Pkg.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl) is the Julia package manager. It has extensive [documentation](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/) for managing packages and developing them as well.
* [Julia Package Download Statistics](https://juliapkgstats.com/) - Package download statistics based on the [announcement](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/announcing-package-download-stats/69073/38).
* [BinaryBuilder](https://binarybuilder.org) - Build native binaries with over 45 well maintained toolchains for major platforms. Refer to the [BinaryBuilder.jl documentation](https://docs.binarybuilder.org/stable/) for details.
* [Yggdrasil](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil) - Recipes for building and distributing binaries and libraries in the Julia ecosystem
