# Discourse

The primary online discussion venue for Julia is the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/). Discourse is the right place to do any of the following:

* **Keep up to date** on important Julia announcements like language releases and JuliaCon.
* **Ask a question** about any aspect of using or developing Julia or its associated packages and tools. The Discourse forum is the best place to get a fast, high-quality answer to your Julia question. There are subcategories for various Julia application domains such as machine learning, finance, visualisation and GPUs. Questions from newcomers are always welcome: you can use the “first steps” tag to highlight your question as one that would benefit other new users.
* **Respond to others’ questions**: our community thrives when people share their knowledge and experience.
* **Announce a new package** or solicit feedback about something you have been developing.
* **Advertise** Julia-related jobs and community events.

For Chinese users a Simplified Chinese version discourse is also hosted by the community. Please click this [Julia中文论坛](https://discourse.juliacn.com/) link.

The Discourse forum replaced the Julia mailing lists, the largest of which were [julia-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-users) and [julia-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-dev), at the end of 2016. Those lists are now read-only but you may like to search them to see if your question has already been raised.
