All participants in the Julia community are requested to read the
[Julia Community Standards](standards/), and abide by them in all Julia related
forums.

# Discourse

The primary online discussion venue for Julia is the Discourse forum at
[discourse.julialang.org](https://discourse.julialang.org/). This is a new site which is
to replace many of the mailing lists below. Announcements will be made on the relevant
lists if and when they are moved.

# Mailing Lists

* [julia-news](https://groups.google.com/group/julia-news) – low traffic mailing list for important announcements, such as new releases.
* [julia-opt](https://groups.google.com/group/julia-opt) – discussions related to numerical optimization in julia. This includes Mathematical Programming (linear, mixed-integer, conic, semi-definite, etc.), constrained and unconstrained gradient-based and gradient-free optimization, and related topics.
* [JuliaBox](https://groups.google.com/group/julia-box) – discussions related to running Julia in the so-called cloud.
* [julia-users-es](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julialanges) – discussions around the usage of Julia in the Spanish language.

## Old lists

The following lists were previously used, and are now in a read-only state for archive purposes:

* [julia-users][julia-users] – discussion around the usage of Julia. New users of Julia can ask their questions here. As a courtesy to others, do check the archives and documentation to see if a particular question is already answered.
* [julia-dev](https://groups.google.com/group/julia-dev) – discussions related to the development of Julia itself. Note that this is not the primary forum for the development of Julia: most of the discussions take place on GitHub instead (see below).
* [julia-stats](https://groups.google.com/group/julia-stats) – special purpose mailing list for discussions related to statistical programming with Julia. Topics of interest include DataFrame support, GLM modeling, and automatic generation of MCMC code for Bayesian models.

# GitHub

We use GitHub to track our source code and for tracking and discussing [issues](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues) (bugs and their fixes, new features, and proposed changes) and [commits](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/commits). GitHub's pages are for Julia's development; for user support, please see [julia-users][julia-users].

There is also a list of [packages](http://pkg.julialang.org/) for Julia, many of which are also hosted on and developed using GitHub.
