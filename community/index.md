# Mailing Lists

The [julia-users][julia-users] mailing list is for discussion around the usage of julia. New users of julia can ask their questions here. As a courtesy to others, do check the archives and documentation to see if a particular question is already answered.

The [julia-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-dev) mailing list is for discussion related to the development of julia itself.

The [julia-stats](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-stats) mailing list is a special purpose mailing list for discussions related to statistical programming with julia. Topics of interest include DataFrame support, GLM modeling, and automatic generation of MCMC code for Bayesian models.

The [julia-opt](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-opt) mailing list is for discussions related to numerical optimization in julia. This includes Mathematical Programming (linear, mixed-integer, conic, semi-definite, etc.), constrained and unconstrained gradient-based and gradient-free optimization, and related topics.

The [JuliaBox](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-box) mailing list is for discussions related to running Julia in the so called cloud.

The [julia-users-es](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/julia-users-es) mailing list is for discussions around the usage of Julia in the spanish language.
