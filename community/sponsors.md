## Infrastructure

As a project, Julia encompasses more than just a repository on GitHub.
Providing a seamless user experience to the Julia community requires a
significant amount of infrastructure. Running this infrastructure is not
cheap and we are grateful to these organizations for providing compute
credits, services, hardware and other support essential for keeping Julia
running:

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) provides a substantial amount of free compute credits every year that powers major parts of our CI and package management infrastructure.
- [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/) provides the Julia project with free CDN services
- [Discourse](https://discourse.org/) is providing a 50% discount on the hosting fees for https://discourse.julialang.org/
- [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/) is hosting a free M1 Mac mini for CI
- [ARM](https://www.arm.com/markets/computing-infrastructure/works-on-arm)/[Equinix](https://deploy.equinix.com/) are providing free access to Aarch64 machines for CI
- [IBM](www.ibm.com) and [OSU OSL](https://osuosl.org/) are providing free access to IBM POWER systems for CI
- [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) is providing free credits improving package server latency to Microsoft Azure customer, most notable GitHub Actions
- [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/) is maintaining data center space for the project and providing a significant number of CI machines
- [MIT's Julia Lab](https://julia.mit.edu/) is maintaining data center for the project space and providing a significant number of CI machines
- [NVIDIA](nvidia.com) has provided both JuliaHub and the Julia Lab with a significant number of free GPUs across various generations of NVIDIA products

## Direct Funding

A number of organizations and funding agencies are or have provided direct funding for Julia maintenance.

### Current funding

- [NASA](nasa.gov) is funding efforts towards the creation of high quality released under award number 80NSSC22K1740. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

- Over the years, [Intel](intel.com) has provided significant funding continuing to support a small development contract for maintenance of Julia on Intel platforms and accelerators.

- Julia receives individual donations from a larger number of individuals through [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/JuliaLang) and [NumFocus](https://numfocus.org/project/julia)

In addition, there are a large number of organizations funding research primarily conducted in Julia or funding
the specific development of certain Julia features. Funding agencies for these efforts include [NSF](https://nsf.gov), [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/), [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/), and the [FAA](https://www.faa.gov/). However, they are not listed here, as this list only includes such funding directly dedicated to ongoing Julia maintenance.

### Past funding

The following organizations have previously directly funded Julia development and maintenance:

* [Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu): [Dr. Jeremy Kepner](https://www.mit.edu/~kepner/) is the founding sponsor of the Julia project.
* [Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/article-detail?newsUrlName=bringing-julia-from-beta-to-1.0-to-support-data-intensive-scientific-computing)
* [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/7999)

# JuliaCon

The annual [JuliaCon conference](https://juliacon.org/) raises money through sponsorship and ticket sales. Excess money after expenses (if any) become part of the general Julia fund at NumFocus, which is used to cover miscellaneous hosting and other expenses of the Julia project.
