# Julia Community - Standards

The Julia community is committed to maintaining a welcoming, civil and constructive environment. We expect the following standards to be observed and upheld by all participants in any community forum (mailing lists, GitHub, IRC, etc.).

### Be respectful and inclusive

Please do not use overtly sexual language or imagery. Do not attack anyone based on any aspect of personal identity, including gender, sexuality, politics, religion, ethnicity, race, age, or ability. Keep in mind that what you write or say in public forums is read or heard by many people who don't know you personally, so please refrain from making prejudiced or sexual jokes and comments – even ones that you might consider acceptable in private. Ask yourself if a comment or statement might make someone feel unwelcomed or like an outsider.

In particular, do not sexualize the term "Julia" or any other aspects of the project. While "Julia" is a female name in many parts of the world, the programming language is not a person and does not have a gender.

### Give credit

All participants in the Julia community are expected to respect copyright laws and ethical attribution standards. This applies to both code and written materials, such as documentation or blog posts. Materials that violate the law, are plagiaristic, or ethically dubious in some way will be removed from officially-maintained lists of resources.

If you believe one of these standards has been violated, you can either file an issue on an appropriate repository or confidentially contact the [Julia Stewards](/community/stewards/) at [stewards@julialang.org](mailto:stewards@julialang.org). Keep in mind that most mistakes are due to ignorance rather than malice.

### Be concise

Constructive criticism and suggestions are welcome, but high-traffic forums do not generally have the bandwidth for extensive discourse. Consider writing a blog post if you feel that you have enough to say on a particular subject.

### For Researchers

We welcome the participation of researchers of all kinds in the Julia community. However, please remember that open source development is a social process and that the participants on the other side of any interaction are (obviously) humans. If you are doing research *on the community or its processes*, you are likely performing Human Subjects Research (HSR) and are expected to abide by the highest standards of ethics and professional practice. Meeting this expectation is your responsibility. In particular, please be aware that Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or other review committees may not have sufficient context or experience to understand the social processes of an open source community. We consider engaging in unethical research (human subject or otherwise) to be a cause for bans or other sanctions from the community.

### Get involved

The Julia community is built on a foundation of reciprocity and collaboration. Be aware that most community members contribute on a voluntary basis, so ideas and bug reports are ok, but demands are not. Pull requests are always welcomed – see the [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to read about how to get started.

### Any concerns?

If you have a conflict or concern that requires resolution, please contact the [Julia Community Stewards](/community/stewards/).
