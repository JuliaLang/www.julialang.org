## Julia GitHub Organizations

Something unique about the Julia Language is the way [the community self organizes into GitHub Organizations](https://youtu.be/cLFfTE2KWrk?t=644). This allows for a higher degree of collaboration and structure that ultimately enables each of these communities to be self sustaining.

The following is a non-comprehensive list of Julia GitHub organizations, grouped by domain. If you're aware of an organization not listed here, please contribute by adding it under the appropriate group. Open a pull request [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/www.julialang.org/blob/main/community/organizations.md) to help us maintain an updated list.

**Note:** Organizations listed here should strive to have at least 2 owners with admin rights, and at least 2 public members. Doing so helps to protect the organization's repositories against a single person being unreachable.
