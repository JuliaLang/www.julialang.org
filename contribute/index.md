# Julia Ecosystem Contributor's guide

## Welcome!
The purpose of this document is to help YOU contribute to the Julia Ecosystem.

- Are you well familiar with Julia and are aware of different ways to contribute? Would you like to develop a package, fix a bug in an existing package or contribute to core Julia? Then the ["Developing a Julia Package"](/contribute/creating_package/) section is for you.


- If you are new either to the language, or are not sure about the aims, importance or ways of contributing, go to ["Contributing is for everyone"](/contribute/contributing_for_everyone) section.
