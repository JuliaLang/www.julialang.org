# Everyone can contribute

You don't need to be a seasoned developer to help Julia grow and improve. Anyone willing to contribute can use this page as a roadmap from zero to hero (or from a hundred to one thousand, if you are a pro contributor already). Both code and non-code contributions are welcome, no matter your level of experience or background. This document aims to help you find out:

- How you can contribute to match your skills and interests.
- Which tools and resources can help you contribute confidently.
- Where you can find ideas for fixes to propose in your first contribution.

## Why should you contribute to Julia?
There is a spectrum of benefits to contributing - some more obvious than others. Open source projects rely on contributions from volunteers, enabling them to grow and develop. You will be making a difference to one of the most quickly growing languages, and the future of open-source software as a whole. Benefits of contributing:

- engage with the community,
- build a track record of public contributions (such as on GitHub) which will help your career,
- build confidence with the language and the libraries,
- gain exposure for your library.

Types of contributions vary depending on your experience, background, and the nature of your interest in Julia. You can contribute in one or more of the following ways:

- improve documentation (this includes [fixing typos](#find-a-readme-file-to-edit) and broken links),
- [create a new package](/contribute/creating_package/#creating-a-julia-package),
- [review a package](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/labels/new%20package) submitted to the Julia Registry,
- file a bug report (by creating a [pull request](/contribute/creating_package/#propose-changes-via-pull-requests)),
- [write tests](/contribute/creating_package/#writing-tests),
- [contribute to core Julia](https://github.com/elizavetasemenova/www.julialang.org/blob/main/contribute/index.md#contributing-to-core-julia),
- contribute to other packages (by creating a [pull request](/contribute/creating_package/#propose-changes-via-pull-requests)),

and more.

## Where to get help?

- [The Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) is a space for informal communication with other Julia users and developers. A great way to reach out to people and exchange messages. But bear in mind that messages will disappear over time. It is generally best to ask technical questions on Discourse.

- The Julia [Discourse Forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/) is a place where people discuss development. Questions and answers posted on Discourse remain on the web and public indefinitely. When you post your question there, you are helping a wider community!


## Chose your path
Your next step is to identify which kind of contributor you are.
There are multiple paths, some of which cross. Here is a high-level overview of how you might want to contribute.
The question is: do you want to ...

- Discover
- Connect
  - read the [code of conduct](https://julialang.org/community/standards/)
  - ask questions on Slack or [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/)
  - engage on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JuliaLanguage)
- Learn
  - take a course on [Julia Academy](https://juliaacademy.com/courses?preview=logged_out)
  - do exercises with support from a mentor on [Exercism.io](https://exercism.io/tracks/julia)

  - read a [book written by the Julia community](https://julialang.org/learning/books/)
- Build
  - write a blogpost and [submit it to Julia Bloggers](https://www.juliabloggers.com/julia-bloggers-submit-feed/)
  - cite Julia
  - report a bug
  - make a feature request
  - make a pull request
  - review documentation
  - share a use case
  - develop and submit a package
  - include future pans for your package
- Help
  - spread the word about Julia's Ecosystem
  - submit a use case

  - contribute something that isn't addressed in this guide!

## How do I find contributing opportunities?

If by this point you are convinced that contributing is for you, but don't know where and how to find contributing opportunities, we have collated a couple of ideas for you. For each idea, we have provided a list of *prerequisites* and *estimated time* to make the contribution.


### Find a README file to edit

There are plenty of documentation files in the Julia-verse on GitHub, and typos are so easy to make! You can help clean up documentation by correcting typos, fixing broken links, replacing the mentions of outdated packages and legacy code by their updated and working versions.

- pre-requisites: GitHub account, text editor with spell checking (e.g. MS Word, Google docs)
- estimated time: 1h
- steps:
  - [pick a Julia package](#how-to-find-julia-packages)
  - find a typo to fix (e.g. paste the text into Google docs for a spell-check)
  - go through a few green buttons on GitHub to submit your contribution

### Ask a question on: StackOverflow
- pre-requisites: you do not need an account to find a question, but you will need a StackOverflow account to answer or ask one
- estimated time: depends on the question and your experience with the topic
- steps: open [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and search for questions which are similar to your current question. Make sure the question is not already answered before proceeding! Next, check out the video below which will guide you on asking questions and how this can improve your learning/understanding:

### Find questions to answer: StackOverflow
- pre-requisites: you do not need an account to find a question, but you will need a StackOverflow account to answer one
- estimated time: depends on the question and your experience with the topic
- steps: open [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and search for questions, tagged `[julia]`. For this, enter in the search box tag `[julia]`. You will see a list of the most recent questions related to Julia. Surely, if you are interested in a more specific question, e.g. the Plots library, substitute the search term with `[Plots.jl]`

To stay up-to-date on StackOverflow questions related to Julia, you can also join #stackoverflow-feed channel on [Slack](https://julialang.slack.com). If something you know how to answer comes up - thats' an immediate chance to help!


### Find questions to answer: Discourse
A great place to both post and find questions is on [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/)

- pre-requisites: you do not need an account to find a question, but you will need an account to answer a question
- estimated time: depends on the question and your experience with the topic
- steps: click the 'Reply' button under a question on the Discourse page, and share your knowledge


### Find open issues of packages
- pre-requisites: GitHub account, development tools ([installed Julia](#how-to-install-julia), an [IDE](#what-are-the-ide-options?))
- estimated time: from ~1h to days or months (try starting with simpler issues)
- steps:
  - [pick a Julia package](#how-to-find-julia-packages) and open its GitHub page
  - on GitHub, open the 'Issues' tab
  - open an issue and read through the existing discussion
  - participate in the discussion and/or solve the issue


### How to find Julia packages

The list of Julia packages, organized *thematically*, can be found at https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages. Click on the name of the package to discover its website, GitHub repository, and further details.

The list of packages all registered, organized *alphabetically*, can be found at https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General

## What are the IDE options?

See the Editors and IDEs section on [Julialang.org](https://julialang.org).
