# Platform Specific Instructions for Official Binaries

All official Julia binaries produce portable installations.
Once installed, the directory in which Julia was installed can be moved to a
different location on the same computer, or even to a different computer.

## Windows

Julia is available for Windows 7 and later for both 32 bit and 64 bit versions.

**We highly recommend running Julia using a modern terminal, such as installing the [Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal).**

\newcommand{\winpath}{~~~<code>C:\Users\JohnDoe\AppData\Local\Programs\Julia {{stable_release}}</code>~~~}
\newcommand{\winpathbin}{~~~<code>C:\Users\JohnDoe\AppData\Local\Programs\Julia {{stable_release}}\bin</code>~~~}


### Installation Notes

1.  Download the Windows Julia installer from https://julialang.org/downloads/. Note, the 32-bit Julia binaries work on both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows  (x86 and x86\_64), but the 64-bit Julia binaries only run on 64-bit Windows (x86\_64).
2. Run the installer and note the installation directory. The installation directory should look something like \winpath, *please note this path*.

To invoke Julia by simply typing `julia` in the command line, the Julia executable directory needs to be added to PATH. Perform the following steps to add Julia to PATH.


#### Adding Julia to PATH on Windows 10,

1.  Open Run (Windows Key + R),  type in `rundll32 sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables` and hit enter.
2.  Under either the "User Variables" or "System Variables" section, find the row with "Path", and click edit.
3.  The "Edit environment variable" UI will appear. Here, click "New", and paste in the directory noted from the installation stage. This should look something like \winpathbin.
4.  Click OK. You can now run Julia from the command line, by typing `julia`!

#### Adding Julia to PATH on Windows 7 or 8

1.  Open Run (Windows Key + R),  type in `rundll32 sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables` and hit enter.
2.  In the System Variables window, highlight Path, and click Edit.
3.  In the Edit System Variables window, move the cursor to the end of the field.
4.  If there is no semicolon at the end, add it and paste in the path to the `bin` folder within the installation directory noted earlier. This path should look something like \winpathbin.
5.  Click OK. You can now run Julia from the command line, by typing `julia`!


### Windows 7 / Windows Server 2012 Installation Notes

Windows 7 / Windows Server 2012 users also need to install:

*   the [TLS easy\_fix](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3140245/update-to-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-as-a-default-secure-protocols-in) for the package manager to work, see [this Discourse thread](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/errors-for-git-pkg/9351) for more details.
*   [Windows Management Framework 3.0 or later](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/wmf/overview) to include PowerShell 3.0 or later.

### Uninstallation

Uninstallation is preferably performed by using the Windows uninstaller. The directory in `%HOME%/.julia` can then be deleted if you want to remove all traces of Julia (this includes user installed packages).


## macOS

On macOS, a ~~~<code>julia-{{stable_release}}-mac64.dmg</code>~~~ file is provided, which contains ~~~<code>Julia-{{stable_release_short}}.app</code>~~~. Installation is the same as any other Mac software: drag the ~~~<code>Julia-{{stable_release_short}}.app</code>~~~ to Applications Folder's Shortcut. The Julia download runs on macOS 10.9 Mavericks and later releases. You can build from source for macOS 10.6 Snow Leopard (possibly earlier versions as well) and 32-bit but neither are fully supported.

You can launch Julia by opening the Julia app [like any other application](https://www.howtogeek.com/409411/how-to-launch-applications-on-your-mac/).

### Optional: Add Julia to PATH

If you want to launch Julia from the command line, first [open a new terminal window](https://www.howtogeek.com/682770/how-to-open-the-terminal-on-a-mac/), then run the following snippet from your [shell](https://superuser.com/questions/144666/what-is-the-difference-between-shell-console-and-terminal) (e.g., using the Terminal app, not inside the Julia prompt).

~~~
<pre><code class="language-shell">rm -f /usr/local/bin/julia
sudo ln -s /Applications/Julia-{{stable_release_short}}.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia /usr/local/bin/julia</code></pre>
~~~

This code creates a [symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) to a Julia version (here {{stable_release_short}}) of your choosing.
To launch Julia, simply type `julia` inside your shell and press return.

### Uninstallation

You can uninstall Julia by deleting Julia.app and the packages directory in `~/.julia`. Multiple Julia.app binaries can co-exist without interfering with each other. If you would also like to remove your preferences files, remove `~/.julia/config/startup.jl` and `~/.julia/logs/repl_history.jl`.

## Linux and FreeBSD

It is strongly recommended that the official generic binaries from the downloads page be used to install Julia on Linux and FreeBSD. The following set of commands downloads the latest version of Julia into a directory named ~~~<code>julia-{{stable_release}}</code>~~~.

~~~
<pre><code class="language-shell">wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/{{stable_release_short}}/julia-{{ stable_release }}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar zxvf julia-{{ stable_release }}-linux-x86_64.tar.gz</code></pre>
~~~

### Running Julia

The generic Linux and FreeBSD binaries do not require any special installation steps, but you will need to ensure that your system can find the `julia` executable. The directory where Julia is installed is referred to as `<Julia directory>`.

To run Julia, you can do any of the following:

*   Invoke the `julia` executable by using its full path: `<Julia directory>/bin/julia`
*   Create a symbolic link to `julia` inside a folder which is on your system `PATH`
*   Add Julia's `bin` folder (with full path) to your system `PATH` environment variable

To add Julia's `bin` folder (with full path) to `PATH` environment variable, you can edit the `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile`) file. Open the file in your favourite editor and add a new line as follows:

```shell
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/<Julia directory>/bin"
```

Apart from this, there are several ways through which you can change environment variable. You can follow [this guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables) to find out a way convenient for you.

Julia installs all its files in a single directory. Deleting the directory where Julia was installed is sufficient. If you would also like to remove your packages, remove `~/.julia`. The startup file is at `~/.julia/config/startup.jl` and the history at `~/.julia/logs/repl_history.jl`.

## Cross-platform installer

[Jill.py](https://github.com/johnnychen94/jill.py) is a community-maintained command-line tool that automates the installation workflow for all platforms. After installing this using `pip install jill -U`, you can then use `jill install` to install the current stable release, and `jill install latest` to install the nightly builds.

## Juliaup

An installer and version manager for Julia called [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) is available in the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NJNWW8PVKMN).
It can be used to install specific Julia versions or update to the latest release. This package handles all PATH related aspects of Julia, and alerts users when new Julia versions are released.

# A Brief Note About Unofficial Binaries

There are a variety of distribution-specific packages that are community contributed. They may not use the right versions of Julia dependencies or include important patches that the official binaries ship with. All such distributions are community maintained, and hence they may not always have the latest versions of Julia, and sometimes, the instructions may not work. In general, bug reports will only be accepted if they are reproducible on the official generic binaries on the downloads page.
