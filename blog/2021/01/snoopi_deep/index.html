In the <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2021/01/precompile_tutorial/">first post</a>, we introduced precompilation and some of its constraints. We also pointed out that precompilation is closely tied to <em>type inference</em>:</p> <ul> <li><p>precompilation allows you to cache the results of type inference, thus saving time when you start using methods defined in the package</p> <li><p>caching becomes more effective when a higher proportion of calls are made with inferrable argument types &#40;i.e., type-inference &quot;succeeds&quot;&#41;. Successful inference introduces links, in the form of <code>MethodInstance</code> backedges, that permit the entire call graph to be cached.</p> </ul> <p>As a consequence, anyone interested in precompilation needs to pay attention to type inference: how much time does it account for, where is it spending its time, and what can be done to improve caching? Julia itself provides the internal infrastructure needed to &quot;spy&quot; on inference, and the user-space utilities are in the <a href="https://github.com/timholy/SnoopCompile.jl">SnoopCompile</a> package. Julia 1.2 provided limited facilities for &quot;spying&quot; on inference, and this infrastructure corresponds to SnoopCompile&#39;s <code>@snoopi</code> macro. Julia 1.6 includes new changes that have permitted a far deeper look at what inference is doing. Appropriately enough, SnoopCompile calls this <code>@snoopi_deep</code>.</p> <p>The rich data collected by <code>@snoopi_deep</code> are useful for several different purposes. In this post, we&#39;ll describe the basic tool and show how it can be used to profile inference. Later posts will show other ways to use the data to reduce the amount of type-inference or cache its results.</p> <h2 id=collecting_the_data ><a href="#collecting_the_data">Collecting the data</a></h2> <p>To see <code>@snoopi_deep</code> in action, we&#39;ll use the following demo:</p> <pre><code class=language-julia >module SnoopDemo
    struct MyType&#123;T&#125; x::T end

    extract&#40;y::MyType&#41; &#61; y.x

    function domath&#40;x&#41;
        y &#61; x &#43; x
        return y*x &#43; 2*x &#43; 5
    end

    dostuff&#40;y&#41; &#61; domath&#40;extract&#40;y&#41;&#41;

    function domath_with_mytype&#40;x&#41;
        y &#61; MyType&#40;x&#41;
        return dostuff&#40;y&#41;
    end
end</code></pre> <p>The main call, <code>domath_with_mytype</code>, stores the input in a <code>struct</code>, and then calls functions that extract the field value and perform arithmetic on the result. To profile inference on this call, we simply do the following:</p> <pre><code class=language-julia >julia&gt; using SnoopCompile

julia&gt; tinf &#61; @snoopi_deep SnoopDemo.domath_with_mytype&#40;1&#41;
InferenceTimingNode: 0.009382/0.010515 on InferenceFrameInfo for Core.Compiler.Timings.ROOT&#40;&#41; with 1 direct children</code></pre> <div class=note ><strong>Box 1</strong> Inference gets called only on the <em>first</em> invocation of a method with those specific types. You have to redefine the <code>SnoopDemo</code> module &#40;by re-executing the command we used to define it&#41; if you want to collect data with <code>@snoopi_deep</code> on the same code a second time. This won&#39;t redefine any <code>Base</code> methods that <code>SnoopDemo</code> depends on, so you still may see differences between running this in a fresh session and subsequent uses of <code>@snoopi_deep</code>.</div> <p>This may not look like much, but there&#39;s a wealth of information hidden inside <code>tinf</code>. While optional, before proceeding further it&#39;s recommended to check <code>tinf</code> for hints that <a href="https://julialang.org/blog/2020/08/invalidations/">invalidation</a> may have influenced the result:</p> <pre><code class=language-julia >julia&gt; staleinstances&#40;tinf&#41;
SnoopCompileCore.InferenceTiming&#91;&#93;</code></pre> <p><code>staleinstances</code> extracts <code>MethodInstances</code> that have some &quot;stale&quot; generated code &#40;code that is no longer callable&#41;. In our case, it returns an empty list, meaning that it found no stale instances, which guarantees that no invalidation occurred. There&#39;s nothing &quot;funny&quot; going on behind the scenes that will influence our results.</p> <div class=note ><strong>Box 2</strong> Unlike <code>@snoopr</code>, another macro exported by SnoopCompile, <code>staleinstances</code> does not distinguish between whether that stale code existed before you ran the <code>@snoopi_deep</code> block, or whether it got invalidated during the running of that block. For detailed analysis of invalidations, <code>@snoopr</code> is the recommended tool.</div> <h2 id=inspecting_the_output ><a href="#inspecting_the_output">Inspecting the output</a></h2> <p>In this post, we&#39;ll stick to the basics of inspecting the data collected by <code>@snoopi_deep</code>. First, notice that the output is an <code>InferenceTimingNode</code>: it&#39;s the root element of a tree of such nodes, all connected by caller-callee relationships. Indeed, this particular node is for <code>Core.Compiler.Timings.ROOT&#40;&#41;</code>, a &quot;dummy&quot; node that is the root of all such trees.</p> <p>You may have noticed that this <code>ROOT</code> node prints with two numbers. It will be easier to understand their meaning if we first display the whole tree. We can do that with the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaCollections/AbstractTrees.jl">AbstractTrees</a> package:</p> <pre><code class=language-julia >julia&gt; using AbstractTrees

Indeed, as the calls to <code>getproperty</code> reveal, it goes beyond the types and even shows the results of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">constant propagation</a>; the <code>getproperty&#40;::MyType&#123;Int64&#125;, x::Symbol&#41;</code> &#40;note <code>x::Symbol</code> instead of just plain <code>::Symbol</code>&#41; means that the call was <code>getproperty&#40;y, :x&#41;</code>, which corresponds to <code>y.x</code> in the definition of <code>extract</code>.</p> <div class=note ><p><strong>Box 3</strong> Generally we speak of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph">call graphs</a> rather than call trees. But because inference results are cached &#40;a.k.a., we only &quot;visit&quot; each node once&#41;, we obtain a tree as a depth-first-search of the full call graph.</p> <p>Keep in mind that this can sometimes lead to surprising results when trying to improve inference times. You may delete a node in the graph, expecting to eliminate it and all of its children, only to find that the children are now sitting under a <em>different</em> parent node, the next function to be inferred that calls your child, and was previously relying on it being cached.</p></div> <p>Each node in this tree is accompanied by a pair of numbers. The first number is the <em>exclusive</em> inference time &#40;in seconds&#41;, meaning the time spent inferring the particular MethodInstance, not including the time spent inferring its callees. The second number is the <em>inclusive</em> time, which is the exclusive time plus the time spent on the callees. Therefore, the inclusive time is always at least as large as the exclusive time.</p> <p>The <code>ROOT</code> node is a bit different: its exclusive time measures the time spent on all operations <em>except</em> inference. In this case, we see that the entire call took approximately 10ms, of which 9.3ms was spent on activities besides inference. Almost all of that was code-generation, but it also includes the time needed to run the code. Just 0.76ms was needed to run type-inference on this entire series of calls. As users of <code>@snoopi_deep</code> will quickly discover, inference takes much more time on more complicated code.</p> <p>You can extract the <code>MethodInstance</code> that was being inferred at each node with</p> <pre><code class=language-julia >julia&gt; Core.MethodInstance&#40;tinf&#41;

This occurs when the method is owned by one module but the argument types are from another unrelated module. We&#39;ll see how to deal with these in later installments.</p> <p>You also see breaks in the flamegraph. During these periods, code generation and runtime create new objects and then call methods on those objects; if one of those calls requires a fresh entrance into inference, that triggers the creation of a new flame. Hence, the number of distinct flames &#40;which is just equal to <code>length&#40;tinf.children&#41;</code>&#41; gives you a rough indication of how frequently the chains of inference were broken. This can be caused by type instability, separate top-level calls from the REPL during <code>@snoopi_deep</code>, calls to <code>eval</code> in your code, or some other cause for julia to start running type inference.</p> <h3 id=pprofjl ><a href="#pprofjl">PProf.jl</a></h3> <pre><code class=language-julia >julia&gt; fg &#61; flamegraph&#40;tinf&#41;

julia&gt; using PProf

julia&gt; pprof&#40;fg&#41;
Serving web UI on http://localhost:57599</code></pre> <p>For a detailed walkthrough of how to use PProf, see the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaPerf/PProf.jl">PProf.jl README</a> and, for a more complete guide, the <a href="https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/master/doc/README.md#web-interface">google/pprof web interface README</a>.</p> <p>We have found the most useful views for inspecting an inference profile to be the <code>/flamegraph</code> and <code>/source</code> views. If you navigate to the Flamegraph view, via VIEW -&gt; Flame Graph, this is what you should see:</p> <p><img src="/assets/blog/2021-latency/pprof-flamegraph-full-1.png" alt="PProf Flamegraph in full" /></p> <p>Of course, as above, in this example inference was only a small part of the total time. You can zoom-in on nodes by clicking on them, and hovering will display their full text and time. The nicest way to expand just the inference time is to filter out the <em>non-inference time</em> by &quot;hiding&quot; the <code>ROOT&#40;&#41;</code> node. To do this, type <code>ROOT&#40;&#41;</code> in the <code>Search regexp</code> bar and click REFINE -&gt; Hide, or add <code>?h&#61;ROOT</code> to the URL. This works well if there are several top-level calls to inference, as discussed below. One benefit of hiding and filtering via the Search bar is that the percentages for all nodes will be recomputed as a percentage of the new total.</p> <p>Typing values into the search bar &#40;without pressing enter&#41; will highlight them in the graph, as displayed in the following image, and pressing enter will filter the graph to <em>only</em> contain paths that match your search. These tools can be used to identify small functions that show up often, contributing large amounts of time when aggregated together.</p> <p><img src="/assets/blog/2021-latency/pprof-flamepgraph-no-root-highlight.png" alt="PProf Flamegraph filtered and highlighted" /></p> <p>Here&#39;s a screenshot of the Top view, again with <code>ROOT&#40;&#41;</code> hidden &#40;<code>/top?h&#61;ROOT&#40;&#41;</code>&#41;:</p> <p><img src="/assets/blog/2021-latency/pprof-top-no-root.png" alt="PProf Top view" /></p> <p>More details about using PProf are outside the scope of this post, but here are some things to keep in mind:</p> <ul> <li><p>Sibling frames in pprof are <em>not ordered by time</em>, they are ordered alphabetically. <code>ProfileView</code>, above, is a much better tool for understanding what occurred when during a computation.</p> <li><p>PProf is excellent for interactively exploring &#40;potentially very large&#41; profiles. It provides good high-level summary of the biggest offenders, and includes many tools for understanding their details, including the <code>source</code> view, <code>top</code> view, and filtering.</p> <li><p>You can export profiles to a file via the <code>out&#61;</code> parameter to <code>pprof&#40;&#41;</code>, which are entirely self-contained and can be shared with collaborators for them to view with PProf.</p> </ul> <h2 id=elementary_analysis_flatten_and_accumulate_by_source ><a href="#elementary_analysis_flatten_and_accumulate_by_source">Elementary analysis: <code>flatten</code> and <code>accumulate_by_source</code></a></h2> <p>As our last step for this post, let&#39;s extract the data as a list:</p> <pre><code class=language-julia >julia&gt; flatten&#40;tinf&#41;
