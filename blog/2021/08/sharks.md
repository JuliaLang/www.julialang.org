<!--
NOTE on this blogpost (tlienart@); we could make the cells be
evaluated by Julia on site-build. I don't think that's a good
idea for several reasons:

1. it will have a strong impact on site build time on GitHub
2. if packages go stale, the site build can crash

(2) can be mitigated by shipping specific .toml files but I think
this effectively amounts to having a "frozen" representation of
the code.

As a result, if things change in cells or whatever, a maintainer
will have to execute the code on their side and ensure that the
updated result is updated here too.

This post will demonstrate how to set up and simulate a model of a swimming dogfish shark using [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [WaterLily.jl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsPkfZqbNSQ).
This post is adapted from a [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook that you can get [here]({{base}}notebook.jl).

```julia
using WaterLily, StaticArrays, PlutoUI, Interpolations, Plots, Images
```

We'll use a simple model of the shark based on Lighthill's pioneering [paper on the swimming of slender fish](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112060001110).
It focuses on the "backbone" of the fish; idealizing the shape as a thickness distribution on either side of the center, and the motion as a lateral ("side-to-side") traveling wave. Amazingly, this simple approach provides insight across a huge range of a swimming animals as illustrated in the image below.

## Modeling the shark's thickness and motion

We'll define the thickness and motion distributions using interpolate to fit splines through a few points.

```julia
fit = y -> scale(
        interpolate(y, BSpline(Quadratic(Line(OnGrid())))),
        range(0,1,length=length(y))
    )
```

filename2 = download(url2)
dogfish = load(filename2)
```

The bottom view shows the outline we're interested in, and adding a few points along the length defines the thickness distribution function `thk`.

```julia
plot(dogfish)
nose, len = (30,224), 500
width = [0.02, 0.07, 0.06, 0.048, 0.03, 0.019, 0.01]
scatter!(
	nose[1] .+ len .* range(0, 1, length=length(width)),
	nose[2] .- len .* width, color=:blue, legend=false)
thk = fit(width)
x = 0:0.01:1
plot!(
	nose[1] .+ len .* x,
	[nose[2] .- len .* thk.(x), nose[2] .+ len .* thk.(x)],
	color=:blue)
```

Looking at [videos of swimming dogfish](https://youtu.be/nMa6lD2CQVI?t=200), we can see a couple general features

* The motion of the front half of the body has a small amplitude (around 20% of the tail). This sets the amplitude envelope for the traveling wave.

```julia
envelope = [0.2,0.21,0.23,0.4,0.88,1.0]
amp = fit(envelope)
```

* The wavelength of the traveling wave is a bit longer than the body length

In the code below, you can change the value of $\lambda$ to control the wavelength of the traveling wave to see the impact it has on the backbone over the motion cycle.

```julia
λ = 1.4
scatter(0:0.2:1, envelope)
colors = palette(:cyclic_wrwbw_40_90_c42_n256)
for t in 1/12:1/12:1
	plot!(x, amp.(x) .* sin.(2π/λ * x .- 2π*t),
		  color=colors[floor(Int,t*256)])
end
plot!(ylim=(-1.4,1.4), legend=false)
```

## Setting up the simulation

Now the thickness and motion are defined, but how will we apply these to a fluid simulation? `WaterLily` uses an [immersed boundary method](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/369635/) and [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) to embed a body into the flow.
The upshot is that we don't need to do any meshing; all we need is a signed distance function (SDF) to the surface.

Let's start by defining the SDF to the "backbone", which is a line segment from $x=0\ldots 1$.
[See this great video from Inigo Quilez for a derivation of this sdf.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMltMdi1Wzg).
The plot below shows the sdf and the zero contour, which is ... just a line segment.

Simple adjustments to the SDF give us more control of the shape and position.
By shifting the y offset as `y = y-shift`, we can move the body laterally.
And by subtracting a thickness from the distance as `sdf = sdf-thickness`, we can give the line some width.
This is all we need to model the shark.

```julia
shift = 0.5
T = 0.5

function segment_sdf(x, y)
	s = clamp(x, 0, 1)          # distance along the segment
	y = y - shift               # shift laterally
	sdf = √sum(abs2, (x-s, y))  # line segment SDF
	return sdf - T * thk(s)     # subtract thickness
end

grid = -1:0.05:2
contourf(grid, grid, segment_sdf, clim=(-1,2), linewidth=0)
contour!(grid, grid, segment_sdf, levels=[0], color=:black)  # zero contour
```

![]({{base}}contour.svg)

With the basic SDF tested out, we are ready to set up the WaterLily simulation using the function `fish` defined below:
 - The functions `thk` is passed in to create the `sdf` and the function `amp` is passed in to create the traveling wave `map`.
 - The only numerical parameter passed into `fish` is the length of the fish `L` measured in computational cells. This sets the resolution of the simulation and the size of the fluid arrays.
 - The other parameters are the tail amplitude `A` as a fraction of the length, the [Stouhal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strouhal_number) which sets the motion frequency `ω`, and the [Reynolds number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number) which sets the fluid viscosity `ν`.

```julia
function fish(thk, amp, k=5.3; L=2^6, A=0.1, St=0.3, Re=1e4)
	# fraction along fish length
	s(x) = clamp(x[1]/L, 0, 1)

	# fish geometry: thickened line SDF
	sdf(x,t) = √sum(abs2, x - L * SVector(s(x), 0.)) - L * thk(s(x))

	# fish motion: travelling wave
	U = 1
	ω = 2π * St * U/(2A * L)
	function map(x, t)
		xc = x .- L # shift origin
		return xc - SVector(0., A * L * amp(s(xc)) * sin(k*s(xc)-ω*t))
	end

	# make the fish simulation
	return Simulation((4L+2,2L+2), [U,0.], L;
						ν=U*L/Re, body=AutoBody(sdf,map))
end

# Create the swimming shark
L,A,St = 3*2^5,0.1,0.3
swimmer = fish(thk, amp; L, A, St);

# Save a time span for one swimming cycle
period = 2A/St
cycle = range(0, 23/24*period, length=24)
```

We can test our geometry by plotting the immersed boundary function `μ₀`; which equals 1 in the fluid and 0 in the body.

```julia
@gif for t ∈ cycle
	measure!(swimmer, t*swimmer.L/swimmer.U)
	contour(swimmer.flow.μ₀[:,:,1]',
			aspect_ratio=:equal, legend=false, border=:none)
end
```

## Running visualizing and measuring the simulation

That animation of the motion looks great, so we are ready to run the flow simulator!

The `sim_step!(sim, t, remeasure=true)` function runs the simulator up to time `t`, remeasuring the body position every time step.
(`remeasure=false` by default since it takes a little extra computational time and isn't needed for statics geometries.)

```julia
# run the simulation a few cycles (this takes few seconds)
sim_step!(swimmer, 10, remeasure=true)
sim_time(swimmer)
```

The simulation has now run forward in time, but there are no visualizations or measurements by default.

To see what is going on, lets make a gif of the vorticity `ω=curl(u)` to visualize the vortices in the wake of the shark.
This requires simulating a cycle of motion, and computing the `curl` at all the points `@inside` the simulation.

```julia
# plot the vorcity ω=curl(u) scaled by the body length L and flow speed U
function plot_vorticity(sim)
	@inside sim.flow.σ[I] = WaterLily.curl(3, I, sim.flow.u) * sim.L / sim.U
	contourf(sim.flow.σ',
			 color=palette(:BuGn), clims=(-10, 10), linewidth=0,
			 aspect_ratio=:equal, legend=false, border=:none)
end

# make a gif over a swimming cycle
@gif for t ∈ sim_time(swimmer) .+ cycle
	sim_step!(swimmer, t, remeasure=true)
	plot_vorticity(swimmer)
end
```

![]({{base}}swimmer2.gif)

This is pretty (CFD does stand for _Colorful Fluid Dynamics_ after all), but also tells us something important about the flow.
Notice that there are no eddies coming off the body anywhere other than the tail!
This is a sign of efficiency since energy is only used to create those trailing vortices.

We can dig in and get some quantitative measurements from the simulation as well.
The function `∮nds` takes a integral over the body surface.
By passing in the pressure `p`, we can measure the thrust force and side force generated by the shark!

```julia
function get_force(sim, t)
	sim_step!(sim, t, remeasure=true)
	return WaterLily.∮nds(sim.flow.p, sim.body, t*sim.L/sim.U) ./ (0.5*sim.L*sim.U^2)
end
forces = [get_force(swimmer, t) for t ∈ sim_time(swimmer) .+ cycle]

scatter(cycle./period, [first.(forces), last.(forces)],
		labels=permutedims(["thrust", "side"]),
		xlabel="scaled time",
		ylabel="scaled force")
```

![]({{base}}forces.svg)


We can learn a lot from this simple plot.
For example, the side-to-side force has the same frequency as the swimming motion itself while the thrust force has double the frequency, with a peak every time the tail passes through the centerline.

## Next steps

This simple model is a great start and it opens up a ton of avenues for improving the shark simulation and suggesting research questions:
 - The instantaneous net forces should be zero in a free swimming body! We could add reaction motions to our model to achieve this. Would the model shark swim in a straight line if we did this, or is a control-loop needed?
 - Real sharks are 3D (gasp!). While we could easily extend this approach using 2D splines, it will take much longer to simulate. Is there a way use GPUs to accelerate the simulations without completely changing the solver?
 - If we were going to make a bio-inspired robot of this shark, we will have constraints on the shape and motion and powering available. Can we use this framework to help optimize our robotic within it's contraints?
