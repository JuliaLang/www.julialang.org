## JuMP-Dev 2021

We were excited to have the JuMP-dev conference co-located within JuliaCon for the first time this year. It was an awesome opportunity to get the users and developers from the JuMP-dev community engaged with the greater Julia community. You can check out the JuMP videos from conference in [this JuMP dedicated playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6Rf8_oh9oR2bNeBO-Rw8pzc).

## Code, Docs and Tests: What’s In the General Registry?

Mosè Giordano and Eric P. Hanson presented [Code, Docs and Tests: What’s In the General Registry?](https://live.juliacon.org/talk/HVSAW9)

The General registry is the collection of open source packages that makes up the Julia package ecosystem. The Julia General registry has **11.8 million lines of code** (including docs and tests). More than 96% of packages have an Open Source Initiative approved license, 88% have at least 20 lines of readme or docs, 96% have run tests, 95% have setup for continuous integration, 58% of packages have at least 2 contributors, 93% have at least 10 commits, 48% of contributors have contributed to two or more packages and 60% of contributors have made at least 5 commits. There are more than 5,000 Julia contributors who have contributed to packages in the General registry. You can read more in this [blog post by Mosè and Eric](https://julialang.org/blog/2021/08/general-survey/).

## State of Julia

Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Keno Fischer and Viral Shah presented the [State of Julia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlFVwabDh6Q&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Q343_8sSq4f306VGLW4TLK&index=222), including recent and future improvements.

These include speed increases for CSV.jl and DataFrames.jl, packages reaching 1.0, threading roadmap, faster method insertion, small type info improvements, inference improvements, subtyping and intersection fixes and speedups, CI stability, latency, system images, array optimizations, GC performance, compiler extensibility, new compiler directions, AbstractInterpreter, OpaqueClosure, compiler plugins, Automatic Differentiation, BLAS, sparse matrices and linear algebra.

## Julia User & Developer Survey

The third annual [Julia User & Developer Survey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XSk5zybfic) was presented. 2,660 Julia users and developers from 104 countries participated, and explained how much and why they love Julia and the Julia community, as well as their biggest pain points and areas for improvement.
