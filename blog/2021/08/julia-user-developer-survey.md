We conducted the 3rd annual Julia User & Developer Survey from June 2 – July 7, 2021\. The results were presented by [Andrew Claster during JuliaCon on July 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XSk5zybfic). Click here for the [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XSk5zybfic) and [slides](https://julialang.org/assets/2021-julia-user-developer-survey.pdf).  

2,660 Julia users and developers from more than 104 countries on six continents completed the survey. We recruited respondents online using Slack, Discourse, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, email, JuliaLang.org and JuliaComputing.com. The survey was administered in 4 languages: English, Chinese, Japanese and Spanish.  

**Summary**  

Among Julia users and developers, Python is #2 after Julia. Python holds second-place behind Julia on several metrics: popularity, frequency of usage, and what Julia users would be using as their second choice if they weren’t using Julia.  

The top reasons users and developers started using Julia include:  

1.  Julia seems like the language of the future (63%)
2.  Elegance of Julia (53%)
3.  Julia is faster (46%)
4.  Julia solves the two language problem (44%)
5.  Julia has preferable syntax compared to other languages (43%)

**But the love for Julia extends beyond participants in the Julia User & Developer Survey.** In the [2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted), Julia ranked 5th out of 38 languages on ‘most loved languages’ - ahead of Python, Swift and Go.  

**Julia’s Most Popular Features and Biggest Problems**  

The most popular technical features of Julia are:  

1.  Speed, performance
2.  Ease of use
3.  Open source
4.  Multiple dispatch
5.  Package manager
6.  Solves the two language problem
7.  Composable

The most popular non-technical features of Julia are:  

1.  Free (You don’t have to pay to use it.)
2.  Julia community

The biggest non-technical problems with Julia are related to adoption: too many colleagues, collaborators, employers and companies are still using other languages.  

**Packages:** 74% of Julia users and developers say that the Julia package ecosystem is robust; just 14% say it is not robust.  

**Julia Community**: 83% of Julia users and developers say that the Julia community is very (58%) or somewhat (25%) helpful and collaborative. Only 2% say that the Julia community is not helpful and collaborative. The percentage of Julia users and developers who say the Julia community is ‘very’ helpful and collaborative has grown steadily from 47% in 2019 to 55% in 2020 and 58% in 2021.
