Hi Julia Community,

It is with GREAT excitement we are pleased to announce this year's Google Summer of Code projects and the Julia Summer of Code projects!

## Google Summer of Code

To give some quick statistics, we had $26$ proposals we submitted to Google and we were allocated $21$ slots -- that's $\approx 81\%$ of the proposals! Here are the list of projects, their fellows, and the mentors for each project; if you want to learn any [more details about the projects, click here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/the-julia-language).

## Julia Summer of Code

Additionally, the limited number of slots from Google meant that not all projects that we selected could receive a GSoC fellowship. We were however able to offer additional fellowships through the broader Julia Summer of Code umbrella via open source funds.

## Concluding Thoughts

A huge congratulations to all the fellows for this year's Google Summer of Code and Julia Summer of Code cohorts! Additionally, a massive thank you to all the mentors who are overseeing projects this year. We are thrilled to have you all within the Julia Community and are eager to see what all comes next!
