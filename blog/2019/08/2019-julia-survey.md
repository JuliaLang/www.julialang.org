Special thanks to all who participated in the survey!

1,844 Julia users and developers completed the survey from over 90 countries and fluent in more than 60 languages.

Key findings and methodology are below.

1.  It takes too long to generate the first plot

The biggest non-technical problems with Julia are:

1.  Colleagues, company or collaborators use other languages
1.  Not enough Julia users in my field/industry

**Reasons for Trying Julia**

1.  I like learning new languages
1.  I heard about Julia from friends or colleagues and wanted to try it out
1.  Preferable syntax to other languages

**Julia Use**

Most users and developers use Julia for research (73%) or individual work (54%). 15% use Julia for development as part of a team and 10% use Julia in production for business critical task.

45% of Julia users and developers use Julia for at least half of their work.

**Methodology**

The survey was conducted June 12-26, 2019. 1,844 Julia users and developers participated, with a margin of error of +/- 2.3 percentage points. We recruited participants online using Slack, Discourse, Twitter, email, JuliaLang.org and JuliaComputing.com. The survey was administered in English, but more than half of respondents come from non-English speaking countries. Respondents come from more than 90 countries and are fluent in more than 60 different languages.
