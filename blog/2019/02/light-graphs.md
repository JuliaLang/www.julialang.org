This blog briefly summarises my GSoC 2018 project ([Parallel Graph Development](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/5193483178475520/)) and the results achieved. For a detailed description, please refer to my [GSoC blog](https://sohamtamba.github.io/GSoC).

The project is spread over the [LightGraphs](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl) codebase. It involved:

1. Producing parallel implementations of crucial graph algorithms.
2. Improving sequential implementation of crucial graph algorithms in LightGraphs.
3. Implementing heuristics to obtain good solutions to crucial NP-Hard graph problems.

The benchmarks were conducted on a 64-bit linux machine using 4 cores.

###  Completed but not applicable

The following branches have not been merged into LightGraphs master as the functionality is not suitable to LightGraphs:

- [Minimum Steiner Tree](https://github.com/SohamTamba/LightGraphs.jl/tree/GSoC/SteinerTree)
- [Metric Travelling Salesman](https://github.com/SohamTamba/LightGraphs.jl/tree/GSoC/TravellingSalesman)

###  Requires Improvement

The following branches have not been merged into LightGraphs as the parallel implementations are slower than the sequential implementation:

- [Parallel Kruskal MST](https://github.com/SohamTamba/LightGraphs.jl/tree/Parallel_Kruskal)
- [Parallel Prim MST](https://github.com/SohamTamba/LightGraphs.jl/tree/BatchPriorityQueue_Parallel_Dijkstra_Prim)
- [Parallel Dijkstra SSSP](https://github.com/SohamTamba/LightGraphs.jl/tree/BatchPriorityQueue_Parallel_Dijkstra_Prim)
