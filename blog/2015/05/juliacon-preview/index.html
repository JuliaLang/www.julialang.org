JuliaCon is back for 2015, this time in Cambridge, Massachusetts at <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>&#39;s architecturally-delightful Stata Center, the <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/">home of computer science at MIT</a>. Last year we had a single-track format, but this year we&#39;ve expanded into a four-day extravaganza:</p> <ul> <li><p>On Wednesday 24th there will an introduction to Julia workshop run by <a href="https://github.com/dpsanders">David P. Sanders &#40;@dpsanders&#41;</a> as well as a Julia <strong>hackathon</strong> - a great chance to get some help for your new Julia projects, or to begin contributing to Julia or its many packages.</p> <li><p>On Thursday 25th and Friday 26th we will be having speakers talking about a range of topics - we were fortunate to have so many fantastic submissions that we had to open up a second track of talks. The near-final <a href="https://juliacon.org">schedule is on the main page</a>. We&#39;ll be alternating between ~40 minute long &quot;regular&quot; talks, and ~10 minute long &quot;lightning&quot; talks across all the sessions.</p> <li><p>On Saturday 27th we will finish with a series of <strong>workshops</strong> on a range of topics: data wrangling and visualization, <a href="http://www.juliaopt.org/">optimization</a>, high-performance computing and more. These workshops run from 1.5 to 3 hours and will be a great way to rapidly boost your Julia skills.</p> </ul> <h3 id=thursdays_talks ><a href="#thursdays_talks">Thursday&#39;s Talks</a></h3> <img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6486271" width="20%"><img src="/assets/images/juliaastro.svg" width="20%"><img src="/assets/images/juliacloud.svg" width="20%"> <p>After getting everyone settled in, we&#39;ll start the conference proper with a session about the use of Julia in a wide variety of <strong>scientific applications</strong>. Many of the talks at the conference focus on Julia package organizations: groupings of similar packages that promote interoperability and focussing of efforts. In the session <a href="https://github.com/dcjones">Daniel C. Jones &#40;@dcjones&#41;</a>, the creator of the visualization package <a href="https://gadflyjl.org">Gadfly</a>, will discuss the advances being made in the <a href="https://github.com/BioJulia">BioJulia</a> <strong>bioinformatics</strong> organization, and <a href="https://github.com/kbarbary">Kyle Barbary &#40;@kbarbary&#41;</a> will present <a href="https://juliaastro.github.io/">JuliaAstro</a>, a home for <strong>astronomy and astrophysics</strong> packages. Theres something for everyone: quantitative <strong>economic modeling</strong> &#40;<a href="https://quantecon.org/">QuantEcon.jl</a>&#41;, <strong>quantum statistical simulations</strong>, and how to fit Julia into a pre-existing body of code in other languages.</p> <p>After lunch we&#39;ll be splitting into two tracks: <strong>visualization and interactivity</strong> and <strong>statistics</strong>. The <strong>visualization</strong> track will be demonstrating some of the exciting advances being made that enable Julia to both produce high-quality visualizations, but also share them. <a href="https://github.com/one-more-minute">Mike Innes &#40;@one-more-minute&#41;</a>, creator of the <strong><a href="https://junolab.org/">Juno</a> IDE for Julia</strong>, will be sharing his working on building <strong>web-powered apps</strong> in Julia, while <a href="https://github.com/ViralBShah">Viral B. Shah &#40;@ViralBShah&#41;</a>, one of the Julia founders, will be discussing more about the inner workings of and plans for <strong><a href="https://juliabox.org">JuliaBox</a></strong>. For a different take on &quot;visualization&quot;, <a href="https://github.com/jminardi">Jack Minardi of Voxel8</a> will be sharing how Julia is powering their <strong>3D printing work</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>statistics</strong> session covers some hot topics in the field, including two talks from researchers at MIT about how Julia is playing a big part: <strong>probabilistic programming</strong> &#40;<a href="https://github.com/zenna/Sigma.jl">Sigma.jl</a>&#41; and <strong>deep learning</strong> &#40;<a href="https://github.com/pluskid/Mocha.jl">Mocha.jl</a>&#41;. Facebooker John Myles White, author of <a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018483.do">&quot;Machine Learning for Hackers&quot;</a> and a variety of packages in R and Julia, will share his thoughts on how statistics in Julia can be taken to the next stage in development, and <a href="https://github.com/ninjin">Pontus Stenetop &#40;@ninjin&#41;</a> will educate and entertain in his talk &quot;Suitably Naming a Child with Multiple Nationalities using Julia&quot;.</p> <p>We&#39;ll come together at the end of Thursday to learn more about how to write <a href="https://github.com/tonyhffong/Lint.jl">good</a> Julia code, how to write packages that Just Work on Windows, and how wrappers around C libraries can be made easier than you might think through the magic of <a href="https://github.com/ihnorton/Clang.jl">Clang.jl</a>. <a href="https://github.com/IainNZ">Iain Dunning &#40;@IainNZ&#41;</a>, maintainer of <a href="https://pkg.julialang.org">Julia&#39;s package listing and test infrastructure</a> will follow up on last years talk by giving a brief history and updated status report on Julia&#39;s package ecosystem. Finally current Googler <a href="https://github.com/astrieanna">Lean Hanson &#40;@astrieanna&#41;</a> will share some of her tips for people looking to get started with contributing to Julia and to open-source projects.</p> <p>Whatever you get up to after the talks end on Thursday, make sure you are up in time for...</p> <h3 id=fridays_talks ><a href="#fridays_talks">Friday&#39;s talks</a></h3> <img src="/assets/images/juliaopt.svg" width="20%"><img src="/assets/images/el.png" width="20%"> <br/><br/> <p>If you are interested in learning <strong>how Julia works</strong> from the people who work on it every day, then Friday morning&#39;s session is for you. The morning will kick off with newly-minted-PhD and Julia co-founder <a href="https://github.com/JeffBezanson">Jeff Bezanson &#40;@JeffBezanson&#41;</a>, who is still recovering from his defense and will be updating us on the title of his talk soon. We&#39;ll be learning more about different stages of the <strong>compilation process</strong> from contributors <a href="https://github.com/jakebolewski">Jake Bolewski &#40;@jakebolewski&#41;</a> and <a href="https://github.com/quinnj">Jacob Quinn &#40;@quinnj&#41;</a>, and we&#39;ll be covering a miscellany of other cutting-edge topics for Julia like tuning LLVM, debugging, and interfaces.</p> <p>In the afternoon we&#39;ll have four sessions split across two rooms. In the second <strong>scientific applications</strong> session we&#39;ll be learning more about how Julia is being used to <strong>prevent airborne collisions</strong> from Lincoln Lab&#39;s Robert Moss, and <a href="https://github.com/IainNZ">Iain Dunning &#40;@IainNZ&#41;</a> will give a sequel to last years <a href="http://www.juliaopt.org/">JuliaOpt</a> talk to update us on how Julia is becoming the language of choice for many for <strong>optimization</strong>. We&#39;ll also hear how Julia is enabling rapid development of advanced algorithms for simulating <strong>quantum systems</strong>, evolving graphs, and analyzing <strong>seismic waves</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>numerical computing</strong> track kicks of with Stanford&#39;s Prof. <a href="https://github.com/poulson">Jack Poulson &#40;@poulson&#41;</a>, creator of the <a href="https://github.com/elemental/Elemental">Elemental</a> library for <strong>distributed-memory linear algebra</strong>. Right after, the linear algebra wizard <a href="https://github.com/xianyi">Zhang Xianyi &#40;@xianyi&#41;</a> will give a talk about <a href="https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS">OpenBLAS</a>, the high-performance linear algebra library Julia ships with. After a break, we&#39;ll hear Viral&#39;s thoughts on how <strong>sparse matrices</strong> currently and should work in Julia, before finishing off with lightning talks about <strong>validated numerics</strong> and <strong>Taylor series</strong>.</p> <p>We&#39;ll see out the day with two sessions that hit some topics of interest to people deploying Julia into larger systems: <strong>data</strong> and <strong>parallel computing</strong>. In the data session we&#39;ll learn how about the nuts and bolts of <strong>sharing and storing data</strong> in Julia and hear more about plans for the future by the contributors working in these areas. Make sure to check out the talk by <a href="https://github.com/aviks">Avik Sengupta &#40;@aviks&#41;</a> about his real-world industry experiences about putting Julia code behind a <strong>web-accessible API</strong>.</p> <p>The parallel computing session will tackle parallelism at all levels. Contributor <a href="https://github.com/amitmurthy/">Amit Murthy &#40;@amitmurthy&#41;</a> will open the session with a discussion of his recent work and plans for managing Julia in a cluster. We&#39;ll also hear about work being done to <strong>make Julia multithreaded</strong> at Intel, and about running Julia on a <strong>Cray supercomputer</strong>.</p> <p>After all that you will surely be inspired to hack on Julia projects all night, but make sure to wake up for a full day of <strong>workshops</strong> on Saturday&#33;</p> <p>Remember to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/juliacon-2015-tickets-16517619645">get your tickets</a> and <a href="https://juliacon.org/#accom">book your hotel</a> before June 4th to take advantage of early bird pricing. We&#39;d also like to thank our <strong>platinum sponsors</strong>: the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, BlackRock, and Julia Computing. We can&#39;t forget out <strong>silver sponsors</strong> either: Intel and Invenia.
