Thanks to a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, I've enjoyed the
Julia Summer of Code 2015 program administered by the NumFOCUS and a travel to
the JuliaCon 2015 at Boston.  During this program, I have created several
packages about data structures and algorithms for sequence analysis, mainly
targeted for bioinformatics.  Even though Julia had lots of practical packages
for numerical computing on floating-point numbers, it lacked efficient and
compact data structures that are fundamental in bioinformatics.

Recent development of high-throughput DNA sequencers has enabled to sequence
massive numbers of DNA fragments (known as reads) from biological samples
within a day.  The first step of sequence analysis is locating positions of
these fragments in other long reference sequence, then we can detect genetic
variants or gene expressions based on the result.  This step is called sequence
mapping or aligning, and because reference sequences are most commonly
genome-scale (about 3.2 billions length for human), a full-text search index is
used to speed up this alignment process.  This kind of full-text search index
is implemented in many bioinformatics tools, most notably
[bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) and
[BWA](http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/), whose papers are cited thousands of
times.

The main focus of my project was creating a full-text search index in Julia
that is easy to use and efficient in practical applications.  In the course
towards this destination, I've created several packages that are useful as a
building block for other data structures.  I'm going to introduce you these
packages in this post.


## IntArrays.jl

[IntArrays.jl](https://github.com/bicycle1885/IntArrays.jl) is a package for arrays of unsigned integer.
So, is it useful? Yes, it is! This is because the `IntArray` type implemented in this package can store integers as small space as possible.
The `IntArray` type has a type parameter `w` that represents the number of bits required to encode elements in an array.
For example, if each element is an integer between 0 and 3, you only need to use two bits to encode it and `w` can be set to 2 or greater.
These 2-bit integers are packed into a buffer and therefore the array consumes only one fourth of the space compared to the usual array.
The following is a case of a byte sequence of `[0x01, 0x03, 0x02, 0x00]`:

~~~
<pre>
    index:                           1          2          3          4
    byte sequence (hex):          0x01       0x03       0x02       0x00
    byte sequence (bin):    0b00000001 0b00000011 0b00000010 0b00000000
    packed sequence (w=2):          01         11         10         00
    in-memory layout:         00101101
</pre>
~~~

The full type definition is `IntArray{w,T,n}`, where `w` is the number of bits
for each element as I explained, `T` is the type of elements, and `n` is the
dimension of the array.  This type is a subtype of the `AbstractArray{T,n}` and
will behave like a familiar array; allocation, random access and update are
supported.  `IntVector` and `IntMatrix` are also defined as type aliases like
`Vector` and `Matrix`, respectively.

Here is an example:

```julia
julia> IntArray{2,UInt8}(2, 3)
2x3 IntArrays.IntArray{2,UInt8,2}:
 0x00  0x00  0x01
 0x00  0x00  0x03

julia> array = IntVector{2,UInt8}(6)
6-element IntArrays.IntArray{2,UInt8,1}:
 0x00
 0x00
 0x03
 0x03
 0x02
 0x00

julia> array[1] = 0x02
0x02

julia> array
6-element IntArrays.IntArray{2,UInt8,1}:
 0x02
 0x00
 0x03
 0x03
 0x02
 0x00

julia> sort!(array)
6-element IntArrays.IntArray{2,UInt8,1}:
 0x00
 0x00
 0x02
 0x02
 0x03
 0x03
```

And the memory footprint of `IntArray` is much smaller:

```julia
julia> sizeof(IntVector{2,UInt8}(1_000_000))
250000

julia> sizeof(Vector{UInt8}(1_000_000))
1000000
```

Since packing and unpacking integers in a buffer require additional operations,
there are overheads in operations and `IntArray` is often slower than `Array`.
I've tried to keep this discrepancy as small as possible, but the `IntArray` is
about 4-5 times slower when sorting it:

```julia
julia> array = rand(0x00:0x03, 2^24);

julia> sort(array); @time sort(array);
  0.488779 seconds (8 allocations: 16.000 MB)

julia> iarray = IntVector{2}(array);

julia> sort(iarray); @time sort(iarray);
  2.290878 seconds (18 allocations: 4.001 MB)
```

If you have a great idea to improve the performance, please let me know!


## IndexableBitVectors.jl

The next package is [IndexableBitVectors.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/IndexableBitVectors.jl).
You must be familiar with the `BitVector` type in the standard library; types defined in my package is a static but indexable version of it.
Here "indexable" means that a query to ask the number of bits between an arbitrary range can be answered **in constant time**.
If you are already familiar with [succinct data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinct_data_structure), you may know this is an important building block of other succinct data structures like wavelet trees, LOUDS, etcetera.

The package exports two variants of such bit vectors: `SucVector` and `RRR`.
`SucVector` is simpler and faster than `RRR`, but `RRR` is compressible and will be smaller if 0/1 bits are localized in a bit vector.
Both types split a bit vector into blocks and cache the number of bits up to the position.
In `SucVector`, the extra space is about 1/4 bits per bit, so it will become ~25% larger than the original bit vector.

The most important query operation over these data structures would be the `rank1(bv, i)` query, which counts the number of 1 bits within `bv[1:i]`. Owing to the cached bit counts, we can finish the rank operation in constant time:

```julia
julia> using IndexableBitVectors

julia> bv = bitrand(2^30);

julia> function myrank1(bv, i)  # count ones by loop
           r = 0
           for j in 1:i
               r += bv[j]
           end
           return r
       end
myrank1 (generic function with 1 method)

julia> myrank1(bv, 2^29); @time myrank1(bv, 2^29);
  0.714866 seconds (6 allocations: 192 bytes)

julia> sbv = SucVector(bv);

julia> rank1(sbv, 2^29); @time rank1(sbv, 2^29);  # much faster!
  0.000003 seconds (6 allocations: 192 bytes)

julia> rrr = RRR(bv);

julia> rank1(rrr, 2^29); @time rank1(rrr, 2^29);  # much faster, too!
  0.000004 seconds (6 allocations: 192 bytes)
```

The `select1(bv, j)` query is also useful in many cases, which locates the
`j`-th 1 bit in the bit vector `bv`.  For example, if a set of positive
integers is represented in this bit vector, you can efficiently query the
`j`-th smallest member in the set.

Let's see the internal representation of `SucVector` to understand the magic.
A bit vector is separated into large blocks:

```julia
type SucVector <: AbstractIndexableBitVector
    blocks::Vector{Block}
    len::Int
end
```

Each large block contains 256 bits and consists of four small blocks which
contain 64 bits respectively, a large block stores *global* 1s' count up to the
starting position of it and a small block stores *local* 1s' count staring from
the beginning position of its parent large block.  Bits itself are stored in
four bit chunks corresponding to small blocks:

```julia
immutable Block
    # large block
    large::UInt32
    # small blocks
    #   the first small block is used for 8-bit extension of the large block
    #   hence, 40 (= 32 + 8) bits are available in total
    smalls::NTuple{4,UInt8}
    # bit chunks (64bits Ã— 4 = 256bits)
    chunks::NTuple{4,UInt64}
end
```

![Block](/assets/blog/2015-10-03-sequence-analysis/sucvector.png)


Since the bit count of the first small block is always zero, we can exploit
this space to extend the cache of the large block (red frame).  When running
the `rank1(bv, i)` query, it first picks a large and small block pair that the
`i`-th bit belongs to and then adds their cached bit counts, finally counts
remaining 1 bits in a chunk on the fly.

As I mentioned, this data structure can be used as a building block of various
data structures. The next package I'm going to introduce is one of them.


## WaveletMatrices.jl

You may already know about the [wavelet
tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavelet_Tree), which supports the *rank*
and *select* queries like `SucVector` and `RRR`, but elements are not
restricted to 0/1 bits.  In fact, the *rank* and *select* queries are available
on arbitrary unsigned integers. The wavelet tree can be thought as a
generalization of indexable bit vectors in this respect.  What I've implemented
is not the well-known wavelet tree, a variant of it called "wavelet matrix".
You can find an implementation and a link to a paper at
[WaveletMatrices.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/WaveletMatrices.jl).
According to the authors of the paper, the wavelet matrix is "simpler to build,
simpler to query, and faster in practice than the levelwise wavelet tree".

The `WaveletMatrix` type takes three type parameters: `w`, `T`, and `B`.  `w`
and `T` are analogous to those of `IntArray{w,T,n}`, and `B` is a type of
indexable bit vector.

```julia
julia> using WaveletMatrices

julia> wm = WaveletMatrix{2}([0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03])
4-element WaveletMatrices.WaveletMatrix{2,UInt8,IndexableBitVectors.SucVector}:
 0x00
 0x01
 0x02
 0x03

julia> wm[3]
0x02

julia> rank(0x02, wm, 2)
0

julia> rank(0x02, wm, 3)
1

julia> xs = rand(0x00:0x03, 2^16);

julia> wm = WaveletMatrix{2}(xs);  # 2-bit encoding

julia> sum(xs[1:2^15] .== 0x03)
8171

julia> rank(0x03, wm, 2^15)
8171
```

The details of the data structure and algorithms are relatively simple but
beyond the scope of this post. For people who are interested in this data
structure, the paper I mentioned above and my implementation would be helpful.
There are more operations that the wavelet matrix can run efficiently and those
operations will be added in the future.


## FMIndexes.jl

80% of sequence analysis in bioinformatics is about sequence search, which
includes pattern search, homologous gene search, genome comparison, short-read
mapping, and so on.  The [FM-Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-index) is
often regarded as one of the most efficient indices for full-text search, and I've
implemented it in the [FMIndexes.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/FMIndexes.jl)
package.  Thanks to the packages I've introduced so far, the code of it looks
really simple.  For example, counting the number of occurrences of a given
pattern in a text can be written as follows (slightly simplified for explanatory
purpose):

```julia
function count(query, index::FMIndex)
    sp, ep = 1, length(index)
    # backward search
    i = length(query)
    while sp â‰¤ ep && i â‰¥ 1
        char = convert(UInt8, query[i])
        c = index.count[char+1]
        sp = c + rank(char, index.bwt, sp - 1) + 1
        ep = c + rank(char, index.bwt, ep)
        i -= 1
    end
    return length(sp:ep)
end
```

A unique property of the FM-Index is that an index itself is just a permutation
of characters of an original text and counts of characters contained in it.
This permutation is called [Burrows-Wheeler
transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows%E2%80%93Wheeler_transform)
(also known as BWT), and the permuted text is stored in a wavelet matrix (or a
wavelet tree) in order to efficiently count the number of characters within a
specific region.  Therefore, the space required to index a text is often
smaller than that of other full-text indices (actually, in practice,
efficiently finding positions of a query needs auxiliary data as well).
Moreover, this transform is
[bijective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection), and thus the original
text can be restored from an index.

Building an index for full-text search is ridiculously simple: just passing a
sequence to a constructor:

```julia
julia> using FMIndexes

julia> fmindex = FMIndex("abracadabra");
```

The `FMIndex` type supports two main queries: `count` and `locate`.  The
`count(query, index)` query literally counts the number of occurrences of the
`query` string and the `locate(query, index)` locates starting positions of the
`query`.  In order to restore the original text, you can use the `restore`
function.  Here is a simple usage:

```julia
julia> count("a", fmindex)
5

julia> count("abra", fmindex)
2

julia> locate("a", fmindex) |> collect
5-element Array{Any,1}:
 11
  8
  1
  4
  6

julia> locate("abra", fmindex) |> collect
2-element Array{Any,1}:
 8
 1

julia> bytestring(restore(fmindex))
"abracadabra"
```

As an example, for bioinformaticians, let's try several queries on a
chromosome.  You also need to install the
[Bio.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/Bio.jl) package to efficiently parse a
[FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) file. The next script reads
a chromosome from a FASTA file, build an FM-Index, and then serialize it into a
file for later use (I love the serializers of Julia, they are available for
free!):

**index.jl**

```julia
using Bio.Seq
using IntArrays
using FMIndexes

# encode a DNA sequence with 3-bit unsigned integers;
# this is because a reference genome has five nucleotides: A/C/G/T/N.
function encode(seq)
    encoded = IntVector{3,UInt8}(length(seq))
    for i in 1:endof(seq)
        encoded[i] = convert(UInt8, seq[i])
    end
    return encoded
end

# read a chromosome from a FASTA file
filepath = ARGS[1]
record = first(open(filepath, FASTA))
println(record.name, ": ", length(record.seq), "bp")
# build an FM-Index
fmindex = FMIndex(encode(record.seq))
# save it in a file
open(string(filepath, ".index"), "w+") do io
    serialize(io, fmindex)
end
```

OK, then create an index for chromosome 22 of human (you can download it from
[here](https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/chromosomes/)):

```
$ julia4 index.jl chr22.fa
chr22: 50818468bp
$ ls -lh chr22.fa.index
-rw-r--r--+ 1 kenta  staff    74M  9 26 06:30 chr22.fa.index
```

After construction finished (this will take several minutes), read the index in
REPL:

```julia
julia> using FMIndexes

julia> fmindex = open(deserialize, "chr22.fa.index");
```

Now that you can execute queries to search a DNA fragment:

```julia
julia> using Bio.Seq

julia> count(dna"GACTTTCAC", fmindex)  # this DNA fragment hits at 111 locations
111

julia> count(dna"GACTTTCACTTT", fmindex)  # this hits at 3 locations
3

julia> locate(dna"GACTTTCACTTT", fmindex) |> collect  # the loci of these hits
3-element Array{Any,1}:
 36253071
 47308573
 34159872

julia> count(dna"GACTTTCACTTTCCC", fmindex)  # found a unique hit!
1

julia> locate(dna"GACTTTCACTTTCCC", fmindex) |> collect
1-element Array{Any,1}:
 36253071

julia> @time locate(dna"GACTTTCACTTTCCC", fmindex);  # this can be located in 32 Î¼s!
  0.000032 seconds (5 allocations: 192 bytes)
```

This locus,
[chr22:36253071](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&position=chr22%3A36253071-36253120&hgsid=446220019_CeC0woSUOd5ov3GLph7a6fs5Uryo),
is the starting position of the *APOL1* gene.

## Applications

My aim of having created these packages was to prove that it is practicable to
implement high-performance data structures for bioinformatics in Julia.  I'm
pretty sure that it is true, but it may be skeptical to others.  So, I'm going
to prove it by writing useful and performant applications using these packages.
Now I'm working on [FMM.jl](https://github.com/bicycle1885/FMM.jl), which
aligns massive amounts of DNA fragments to a genome sequence using the FM-Index
and other algorithms.  This is still a work in progress, there would be many
bugs and unusual cases I should care about, but its performance is not so bad
compared to other implementations.

The [BioJulia](https://github.com/BioJulia) project is also under active
development.  The packages I made are intended to work with the
[Bio.jl](https://github.com/BioJulia/Bio.jl) package.  If you are interested in
the BioJulia project, we really welcome your contributions!
