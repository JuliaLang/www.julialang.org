Arrays are a crucial component of any programming language,
particularly for a data-oriented language like Julia.  Arrays store
values according to their location: in Julia, given a two-dimensional
array `A`, the expression `A[1,3]` returns the value stored at a
location known as `(1,3)`.  If, for example, `A` stores `Float64`
numbers, the value returned by this expression will be a single
`Float64` number.

Julia's arrays conventionally start numbering their axes with 1,
meaning that the first element of a one-dimensional array `a` is
`a[1]`. The choice of 1 vs. 0 seems to generate a certain amount of
discussion. A fairly recent addition to the Julia landscape is the
ability to define arrays that start with an *arbitrary* index.  The
purpose of this blog post is to describe why this might be
interesting.  This is really a "user-oriented" blog post, hinting at
some of the ways this new feature can make your life simpler.  For
developers who want to write code that supports arrays with arbitrary
indices, see
[this documentation page](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/devdocs/offset-arrays).

## Why should we care which indices an array has? A first example

Sometimes arrays are used as simple lists, in which case the indices
may not matter to you. But in other cases, arrays are used as a
discrete representation of a continuous quantity (e.g., values defined
over space or time), and in such cases the array indices correspond to
"location" in a way that may be meaningful.

As a simple example, consider the process of rotating an image:

| img | img_rotated |
|:-:|:-----:|
| ![cameraman](/assets/blog/2017-04-18-offset-arrays/cameraman.png) | ![cameraman_rot](/assets/blog/2017-04-18-offset-arrays/cameraman_rotated.png) |

Many languages provide functions for rotating an image; in Julia, you
can do this with the `warp` function defined in
[ImageTransformations](https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageTransformations.jl).

Things get a little more "interesting" when you want to compare pixels
in the rotated image to those of the original image. How, exactly, do
these pixels match up? In other words, for a location `img[i,j]`, what
is the corresponding `i′,j′` location in `img_rotated`? In many languages,
figuring out these types of geometric alignments may not be a simple
task; it's no exaggeration to say that in complex situations (e.g., a
three-dimensional image with a complex spatial deformation) that one
can spend a day or more figuring out exactly how pixels/voxels in two
images are supposed to be compared.

Why is this such a hard problem? The core problem is that, in most
cases, the language is essentially "lying" to you about the location of
pixels: if arrays always start indexing at 1 along any given axis, the
array indices don't really correspond to an absolute spatial location.
An index of 1 means "first index" rather than "spatial location 1."

So to fix this in Julia, starting with version 0.5 we support arrays
with indices that don't start with 1. Let's illustrate this by
specifying that we want the above rotation to be around a point in the
head of the cameraman. Let's load the image:

```julia
julia> using Images, TestImages

julia> img = testimage("cameraman");

julia> summary(img)
"512×512 Array{Gray{N0f8},2}"
```

`summary` shows that `img` is a grayscale image indexed over the
ranges `1:512×1:512`. Using any of several approaches (e.g.,
[ImageView](https://github.com/timholy/ImageView.jl) and paying
attention to the status bar to get the mouse pointer location), we can
learn that the point `(y=126, x=251)` is in the head of the
cameraman. Consequently, let's define a rotation around this point:

```julia
julia> using Rotations, CoordinateTransformations

julia> tfm = Translation(125,250) ∘ LinearMap(RotMatrix(pi/6)) ∘ Translation(-125,-250)
AffineMap([0.866025 -0.5; 0.5 0.866025], [141.747, -29.0064])
```

This defines `tfm` as the composition of a translation (shifting the
head to the origin) followed by a rotation, and then translating back.
(You can get the
composition operator ``∘`` by typing `\circ` and then hitting TAB.) If we
apply this transformation to the image, we get an interesting result:

```julia
julia> img_rotated = warp(img, tfm);

julia> summary(img_rotated)
"-107:592×-160:539 OffsetArray{Gray{N0f8},2}"
```

Perhaps surprisingly, `img_rotated` is indexed over the range
`-107:592×-160:539`, meaning that we access the upper left corner by
`img_rotated[-107,-160]` and the lower right corner by
`img_rotated[592,539]`. It's not hard to see why these numbers arise,
if we see how the corners of `img` are transformed by `tfm`:

```julia
julia> using StaticArrays

julia> itfm = inv(tfm)
AffineMap([0.866025 0.5; -0.5 0.866025], [-108.253, 95.9936])

julia> itfm(SVector(1,1))
2-element SVector{2,Float64}:
 -106.887
   96.3597

julia> itfm(SVector(512,1))
2-element SVector{2,Float64}:
  335.652
 -159.14

julia> itfm(SVector(1,512))
2-element SVector{2,Float64}:
 148.613
 538.899

julia> itfm(SVector(512,512))
2-element SVector{2,Float64}:
 591.152
 283.399
```

This makes it apparent that the output's indices span the region of
the transformed coordinates.

The fact that the output preserves the coordinates makes it trivial to
compare the images:

```julia
julia> cv = colorview(RGB, paddedviews(0, img, img_rotated, img)...)
```

`paddedviews(0, arrays...)` pads input arrays with 0, as needed, to
give them all the same indices, and `colorview(RGB, r, g, b)` inserts
the grayscale images `r`, `g`, and `b` into the red, green, and blue
channels respectively.  If we visualize `cv`, we see the following:

| around image center | around head (cv) |
|:-------:|:------:|
| ![cameraman](/assets/blog/2017-04-18-offset-arrays/cameraman_overlay_center.png) | ![cameraman_rot](/assets/blog/2017-04-18-offset-arrays/cameraman_overlay.png) |

The image on the left is for reference, showing what a rotation around
the image center would look like when properly aligned. The image on
the right corresponds to the steps taken above, and indeed confirms
that the rotation is around the head. Alternatively, we can focus on
the overlapping portions of these images like this:

```julia
julia> inds = map(intersect, indices(img), indices(img_rotated))
(1:512, 1:512)

julia> imgi = img[inds...];

julia> imgri = img_rotated[inds...];
```

so that `colorview(RGB, imgi, imgri, imgi)` displays as

![cameraman_interior](/assets/blog/2017-04-18-offset-arrays/cameraman_overlay_interior.png)

Since the indices of the pixels encode absolute spatial location, it's
trivial to keep track of how different pixels align: pixel `i,j` in
one image corresponds to pixel `i,j` in the other.  This is true even
if our coordinate transformation were far more complicated than a
simple rotation.

Having motivated why this might be useful, let's take a step back and
walk through array indices a bit more systematically.

## A systematic introduction to arrays with arbitrary indices

In Julia, if we define an array

```julia
julia> A = collect(reshape(1:30, 5, 6))
5×6 Array{Int64,2}:
 1   6  11  16  21  26
 2   7  12  17  22  27
 3   8  13  18  23  28
 4   9  14  19  24  29
 5  10  15  20  25  30
```

then we can refer to a rectangular region like this:

```julia
julia> B = A[1:3, 1:4]
3×4 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  6  11  16
 2  7  12  17
 3  8  13  18
```

For certain applications, one negative to extracting blocks is that
there is no record indicating where the new block originated from:

```julia
julia> B2 = A[2:4, 1:4]
3×4 Array{Int64,2}:
 2  7  12  17
 3  8  13  18
 4  9  14  19

julia> B2[1,1]
2
```

So `B2[1,1]` corresponds to `A[2,1]`, despite the fact that, as
measured by their indices, these are not the same location.

To maintain consistent "naming" of our indices, let's use the
[OffsetArrays](https://github.com/alsam/OffsetArrays.jl) package:

```julia
julia> using OffsetArrays

julia> B3 = OffsetArray(A[2:4, 1:4], 2:4, 1:4)  
# wrap the snipped-out piece in an OffsetArray
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2}} with indices 2:4×1:4:
 2  7  12  17
 3  8  13  18
 4  9  14  19

julia> B3[3,4]
18

julia> A[3,4]
18
```

So the indices in `B3` match those of `A`. Indeed, `B3` doesn't even
have an element "named" `(1,1)`:

```julia
julia> B3[1,1]
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2}}
 with indices 2:4×1:4 at index [1, 1]
Stacktrace:
 [1] throw_boundserror(::OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2}}, ::Tuple{Int64,Int64}) at ./abstractarray.jl:426
 [2] checkbounds at ./abstractarray.jl:355 [inlined]
 [3] getindex(::OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2}}, ::Int64, ::Int64) at /home/tim/.julia/v0.6/OffsetArrays/src/OffsetArrays.jl:89
```

In this case we created `B3` by explicitly "wrapping" the extracted
array inside a type that allows you to supply custom indices.  (You
can retrieve just the extracted portion with `parent(B3)`.)  We could
do the same thing by adjusting the *indices* instead:

```julia
julia> using IdentityRanges

julia> ind1, ind2 = IdentityRange(2:4), IdentityRange(1:4)
(IdentityRange(2:4), IdentityRange(1:4))
```

An [`IdentityRange`](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/IdentityRanges.jl) is a range with indices that match its values, `r[i] == i`. (`ind1, ind2 = OffsetArray(2:4, 2:4), OffsetArray(1:4, 1:4)` would be functionally equivalent.) Let's use `ind1` and `ind2` to snip out the region of the array:

```julia
julia> B4 = A[ind1, ind2]
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2}} with indices 2:4×1:4:
 2  7  12  17
 3  8  13  18
 4  9  14  19

julia> B4[3,4]
18
```

This implements a simple rule of composition:

### If `C = A[ind1, ind2]`, then `C[i, j] == A[ind1[i], ind2[j]]`

Consequently, if your indices have their own unconventional indices,
they will be propagated forward to the next stage.

This technique can also be used to create a "view":

```julia
julia> V = view(A, ind1, ind2)
SubArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2},Tuple{IdentityRanges.IdentityRange{Int64},IdentityRanges.IdentityRange{Int64}},false} with indices 2:4×1:4:
 2  7  12  17
 3  8  13  18
 4  9  14  19

julia> V[3,4]
18

julia> V[1,1]
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access SubArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2},Tuple{IdentityRanges.IdentityRange{Int64},IdentityRanges.IdentityRange{Int64}},false} with indices 2:4×1:4 at index [1, 1]
Stacktrace:
 [1] throw_boundserror(::SubArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2},Tuple{IdentityRanges.IdentityRange{Int64},IdentityRanges.IdentityRange{Int64}},false}, ::Tuple{Int64,Int64}) at ./abstractarray.jl:426
 [2] checkbounds at ./abstractarray.jl:355 [inlined]
 [3] getindex(::SubArray{Int64,2,Array{Int64,2},Tuple{IdentityRanges.IdentityRange{Int64},IdentityRanges.IdentityRange{Int64}},false}, ::Int64, ::Int64) at ./subarray.jl:184
```

Note that this object is a *conventional* `SubArray` (it's not an
`OffsetArray`), but because it was passed `IdentityRange` indices it
preserves the indices of the indices.

## A second application: array/image filtering (convolution)

As illustrated above for the image rotation example, a recent release
(v0.6.0) of the Images package put both the power and responsibility
for dealing with arrays with custom indices into the hands of users.
One of the key functions in this package is `imfilter` which can be
used to smooth or otherwise "filter" arrays. The idea is that starting
from an array `A`, each local neighborhood is weighted by a "kernel"
`kern`, producing an output value according to the following formula:

$$ F[I] = \sum_J A[I+J] kern[J] $$

This is the formula for
[correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation); the
formula for another operation,
[convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution), is very
similar.

Let's start with a trivial example: let's filter with a "delta
function" kernel, meaning it has value `1` at location 0 and is zero
everywhere else. According to the correlation formula, because `kern[J]`
is 1 at `J==0`, this should simply give us a copy of our original array:

```julia
julia> using Images

julia> imfilter(1:8, [1])
WARNING: assuming that the origin is at the center of the kernel;
to avoid this warning, call `centered(kernel)` or use an OffsetArray
Stacktrace:

8-element Array{Int64,1}:

 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
```

The warning is telling you that Images decided to make a guess about
your intention, that the kernel `[1]` was intended to be centered around zero. You can
suppress the warning by explicitly passing the following kernel
instead:

```julia
julia> kern = centered([1])
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,1,Array{Int64,1}} with indices 0:0:
 1

julia> kern[0]
1

julia> kern[1]
ERROR: BoundsError: attempt to access OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,1,Array{Int64,1}} with indices 0:0 at index [1]
Stacktrace:
 [1] throw_boundserror(::OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,1,Array{Int64,1}}, ::Tuple{Int64}) at ./abstractarray.jl:426
 [2] checkbounds at ./abstractarray.jl:355 [inlined]
 [3] getindex(::OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,1,Array{Int64,1}}, ::Int64) at /home/tim/.julia/v0.6/OffsetArrays/src/OffsetArrays.jl:94
```

By using an `OffsetArray` you have clearly specified your intended indices for `kern`.

This can be used to shift an image in the following way (by default, `imfilter` returns its results over the same domain as the input):

```julia
julia> kern2 = OffsetArray([1], 2:2)  # a delta function centered at 2
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,1,Array{Int64,1}} with indices 2:2:
 1

julia> imfilter(1:8, kern2, Fill(0))  # pad the edges of the input with 0
8-element Array{Int64,1}:
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 0
 0

julia> kern3 = OffsetArray([1], -5:-5)   # a delta function centered at -5
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,1,Array{Int64,1}} with indices -5:-5:
 1

julia> imfilter(1:8, kern3, Fill(0))
8-element Array{Int64,1}:
 0
 0
 0
 0
 0
 1
 2
 3
```

These are all illustrated in the following figure:

![deltafunctions](/assets/blog/2017-04-18-offset-arrays/filtering.png)

In this figure, we plotted the kernel as if it were at the location
corresponding to convolution rather than correlation.

In other programming languages, when filtering with a kernel that has
an even number of elements, it can be difficult to remember which of
the two middle elements corresponds to the origin.  In Julia, that's
not an issue, because you can make that choice for yourself:

```julia
julia> kern = OffsetArray([0.5,0.5], 0:1)
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,1,Array{Float64,1}} with indices 0:1:
 0.5
 0.5

julia> imfilter(1:8, kern, Fill(0))
8-element Array{Float64,1}:
 1.5
 2.5
 3.5
 4.5
 5.5
 6.5
 7.5
 4.0

julia> kern = OffsetArray([0.5,0.5], -1:0)
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Float64,1,Array{Float64,1}} with indices -1:0:
 0.5
 0.5

julia> imfilter(1:8, kern, Fill(0))
8-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.5
 1.5
 2.5
 3.5
 4.5
 5.5
 6.5
 7.5
```

Likewise, sometimes we might have an application where we simply can't
handle the edges properly, and we wish to discard them.  For example,
consider the following quadratic function:

```julia
julia> a = [(i-3)^2 for i = 1:9]  # a quadratic function
9-element Array{Int64,1}:
  4
  1
  0
  1
  4
  9
 16
 25
 36

julia> imfilter(a, Kernel.Laplacian((true,)))
9-element Array{Int64,1}:
  -3
   2
   2
   2
   2
   2
   2
   2
 -11
```

Those weird values on the edges (for which there is no padding that
will "extrapolate" the quadratic) might cause problems. Consequently,
let's only extract the values that are well-defined, meaning that all
inputs to the correlation formula have explicitly-assigned values:

```julia
julia> imfilter(a, Kernel.Laplacian((true,)), Inner())
OffsetArrays.OffsetArray{Int64,1,Array{Int64,1}} with indices 2:8:
 2
 2
 2
 2
 2
 2
 2
```

Notice that in this case, it returned an `OffsetArray` so that the
values in the result align properly with the original array.

## A final application: Fourier transforms

There are many more things you can do with custom indices.  As one
last illustration, consider the
[Discrete Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform),
which is defined on a periodic domain.  Typically, it's rather
difficult to emulate a periodic domain with arrays, because arrays
have finite size.  However, it's possible to define indexing objects
which possess periodic behavior.  Here we use the
[FFTViews](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/FFTViews.jl) package,
demonstrating the technique on a simple sinusoid:

```julia
julia> using FFTViews

julia> a = [sin(2π*x)+0.1 for x in linspace(0,1,16)];

julia> afft = FFTView(fft(a))
FFTViews.FFTView{Complex{Float64},1,Array{Complex{Float64},1}} with indices FFTViews.URange(0,15):
       1.6+0.0im
     1.498-7.53098im
 -0.288537+0.69659im
 -0.236488+0.35393im
 -0.222614+0.222614im
 -0.216932+0.14495im
 -0.214217+0.0887316im
 -0.212937+0.0423558im
 -0.212557+0.0im
 -0.212937-0.0423558im
 -0.214217-0.0887316im
 -0.216932-0.14495im
 -0.222614-0.222614im
 -0.236488-0.35393im
 -0.288537-0.69659im
     1.498+7.53098im
```

Now, as every student of Fourier transforms learns, the 0-frequency bin holds the sum of the values in `a`:

```julia
julia> afft[0]
1.6000000000000003 + 0.0im
```

Since the mean of a sinusoid is zero, this is (within roundoff error) 16*0.1 = 1.6.

We can also check the amplitude at the Fourier-peak, and explore the
periodicity of the result:

```julia
julia> afft[1]
1.4980046017247872 - 7.53097769363728im

julia> afft[-1]      # negative frequencies are OK
1.4980046017247872 + 7.53097769363728im

julia> afft[64+1]    # look Ma, it's periodic!
1.4980046017247872 - 7.53097769363728im

julia> length(indices(afft,1))   # but we still know how big it is
16
```

Given the periodicity of `afft`, the commonly-used `fftshift` function
(e.g., `fftshift(fft(a))`) can be replaced by `afft[-8:7]`. While very simple,
these techniques make it surprisingly more pleasant to deal with what
can sometimes become complex and error-prone index gymnastics.

## Summary: a user's perspective

This has only scratched the surface of what's possible with custom
indices.  In the opinion of the author, their main advantage is that
they can increase the clarity of code by ensuring that "names"
(indices) can be endowed with *absolute meaning*, rather than always
being "referenced to whatever the first element of this particular
array happens to encode."

There is quite a lot of code that hasn't yet properly accounted for
the possibility of custom indices — surely, some of it written by the
author of this post! So users should be prepared for the possibility
that exploiting custom indices will trigger errors in base Julia or in
packages.  Rather than giving up, users are encouraged to report such
errors as issues, as this is the only way that custom indices will,
over the course of time, have solid support.

## Summary: a developer's perspective

For some algorithms, there appears to be little reason to ever use
arrays with anything but 1-based indices; in such cases, there may be
no reason to modify existing code.  But if your code has a "spatial"
interpretation--where location has meaning--then you just might want
to give the new facilities a try.

In transitioning existing code, the author of this post has observed
the following tendencies:

- algorithms that exploit custom indices are sometimes simpler to
  understand than their "1-locked" counterparts;

- if you're porting old code to support custom indices, there's some
  bad news: if you had to think carefully about the indexing the first
  time you wrote it, it usually requires significant investment to
  re-think the indexing, even if the end result is somewhat simpler.

- even when a specific algorithm might gain little advantage from
  supporting arbitrary indices, writing code that is "indices aware"
  from the beginning is often no harder than writing algorithms that
  implicitly assume indexing starts at 1.
