I'll be giving a talk on Julia at the [New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup on May 1st](https://www.meetup.com/nyhackr/events/60839932/). After my presentation, [John Myles White](https://www.johnmyleswhite.com/) and [Shane Conway](https://www.statalgo.com/) are going to give followup demos of statistical applications using Julia. Then we're going to hang out and grab drinks nearby. Thanks to [Harlan Harris](http://www.harlan.harris.name/) and [Drew Conway](http://www.drewconway.com/) for setting the whole thing up!

**Announcement:**

After a brief hiatus, we are very excited to announce our May meetup will feature one of the hottest new languages in statistical computing: Julia.  We are delighted to welcome Stefan Karpinski, one of the creators of Julia, to give an introduction to the language and his perspective on statistical computing.

Julia is a general-purpose, high-level, dynamic language in the tradition of Lisp, Perl, Python and Ruby. It is designed to take advantage of modern techniques for executing dynamic languages with statically-compiled performance. As part of this design, the language has an expressive type system, which programmers may leverage for dispatch and error checking — incidentally providing the compiler with useful type information. Using types is entirely optional, however: "typeless Julia" is a valid and useful subset of the language, similar to traditional dynamic languages, which nevertheless runs at statically compiled speeds.\

Julia is especially good at running Matlab and R-style programs. Given its level of performance, we envision a new era of technical computing where libraries can be developed in a high-level language instead of C or Fortran. We have also experimented with cloud API integration, and begun to develop a web-based interactive computing environment. The ultimate goal is to make cloud-based supercomputing as easy and accessible as Google Docs.

We will also hear from a mix of people who have already started developing in Julia and see some examples of what they have developed.

The meetup will follow our typical schedule: pizza will begin at 6:15pm, Stefan will begin promptly at 7pm, and we will head to The Central Bar around 8:30pm.

**Update:** You can see the slides for the talk [here](/assets/blog/nyhackr.pdf). There was no video of the talk, but hopefully the slides are informative — there are, among other things, a lot of code examples that should just work if pasted into the Julia repl.
