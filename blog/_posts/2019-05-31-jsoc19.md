title:  A Summer of Julia 2019
author: Avik Sengupta
---

Every summer, we welcome a large group of students working on Julia and its packages via the Google Summer of Code program.
Last year, we had 22 amazing students, working on diverse topics from machine learning to graphs to differential equations,
many of whom continue to be valued contributors to our ecosystem. We are incredibly grateful to Google for the amazing
opportunity it provides through GSoC to both the Julia ecosystem as a whole and to the students who are selected.

This year, we recieved an even larger number of very high quality applications, but were offered only 15 slots for GSoC.
Not wanting to lose some very impressive students and their exciting projects, we decided to supplement the program with the Julia
Season of Contributions (JSoC), using some community funds. Details on the program were announced here: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-seasons-of-contributions-to-supplement-gsoc/23922

So we are excited to see what our impressive set of students achieve this summer. Here is a list of all the projects for GSoC and JSoC 2019
