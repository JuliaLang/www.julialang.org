title:  Julia 0.6 Release Announcement
author: The Julia Community
---

The Julia community is thrilled to announce the release of version 0.6.0 of the Julia language.
With a sweeping overhaul of the type system and numerous improvements to syntax and to the
standard library, 0.6.0 is the most transformative release yet.
A comprehensive list of changes in this release is available in the main Julia repository in
the [NEWS](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/release-0.6/NEWS.md#julia-v060-release-notes)
log.

The 0.6 release line is now considered the stable line of releases and is recommended for most
users, as it provides both language and API stability.
As with previous versions, we will continue to update 0.6 with bugfixes, releasing subsequent
0.6.x versions.
Only critical bug fixes will be ported to 0.5 and releases older than 0.5 are now unmaintained.
Work on new features is now taking place on the `master` branch for the 0.7 development cycle.

Binaries are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows on the [main downloads
page](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
We encourage everyone to try it out.

Happy coding!
