title:  Julia 0.4 Release Announcement
author: The Julia Community
---

We are pleased to announce the release of Julia 0.4.0.  This release contains
major language refinements and numerous standard library improvements.
A summary of changes is available in the
[NEWS log](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/release-0.4/NEWS.md)
found in our main repository. We will be making regular 0.4.x bugfix releases from
the release-0.4 branch of the codebase, and we recommend the 0.4.x line for users
requiring a more stable Julia environment.

The Julia ecosystem continues to grow, and there are now
[over 700](http://pkg.julialang.org/pulse.html) registered packages! (highlights below).
JuliaCon 2015 was held in June, and >60 talks are [available to view](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6Sdx4soiGrSefrmOPdUWixM). [JuliaCon India](http://www.juliacon.in/2015) will be held in Bangalore on 9 and 10 October.

We welcome bug reports on our GitHub tracker, and general usage questions on the
users mailing list, StackOverflow, and several [community forums](http://julialang.org/community/).

Binaries are available from the
[main download page](http://julialang.org/downloads/), or visit [JuliaBox](https://juliabox.org/)
to try 0.4 from the comfort of your browser. Happy Coding!

***************************

**Notable compiler and language news:**

- [Incremental code caching for packages](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/8745),
  resulting in a major reduction in loading time for [Gadfly](http://gadflyjl.org/) and other large,
  inter-dependent packages.
- [Generational garbage collector](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/5227) which greatly
  reduces GC overhead for many common workloads.
- [Function call overloading for arbitrary objects](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/8712)
- [Generated functions](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/7311) (sometimes known as "staged functions") introduce finer control
  over compile-time specialization.
  [Docs](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/metaprogramming/#generated-functions)
  and related [JuliaCon talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAN8zbM659o&list=PLP8iPy9hna6Sdx4soiGrSefrmOPdUWixM&index=55).
- [Support for documenting user functions and other objects](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/8791)
  and retrieving the documentation via the help system.
- Improvements in the performance and flexibility of [multidimensional abstract arrays](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/10525),
  [SubArrays (array views)](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/8501),
  and efficient [multidimensional iterators](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/8432).
- [Inter-task channels](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/12264) for faster communication between parallel tasks
- [Tuple type improvements](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/10380): the type tuple `(A,B)`
  now written `Tuple{A,B}`. This change has improved the performance of many tuple-related operations, and allowed one to write fixed-size aggregate fields
  as `field::NTuple{N,T}` (`N`umber of elements of given `T`ype).
- Major improvements in Julia's test coverage and the ability to analyze the test coverage of packages
- The command line (REPL) now supports [tab-completion of emoji characters](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/10709) (common LaTeX symbols have been supported since 0.3!)

***************************

**Upcoming work for 0.5**

Nightly builds will use the versioning scheme 0.5.0-dev.

- A major focus of 0.5 will be further (breaking) improvements to core array functionality, as detailed
  in [this issue](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/13157).
- We plan to merge the [threading branch](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/13410),
  but the functionality will be considered experimental and only available as a compile-
  time flag for the near future.
