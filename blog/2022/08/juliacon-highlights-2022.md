Another successful JuliaCon is officially in the books! This year, we had 7,986 free registrations via Eventbrite with over 220 people opting to make a donation to the Julia Project while signing up. Between the period of July 19th (start of workshops) - July 30th (last day of the conference), we had over 41,000 unique viewers on the Julia Language’s YouTube and 10,000+ more across the PyData YouTube along with other venues like LinkedIn despite the Summer of 2022 including travel plans for many along with virtual conference burnout. This year’s conference boasted the highest quality content to date, with more engagement overall than we have seen in previous years.

# Julia Community Prize Winners

We wanted to give another warm congratulation to the [2022 Julia Community Prize winners](https://juliacon.org/2022/prize/). This year’s winners are:

- Morten Piibeleht, Michael Hatherly, Fredrik Ekre, and Mauro Werder (For their work on Documenter.jl and its ecosystem)
- Frames White (For her many technical and community contributions across the Julia ecosystem)
- Shuhei Kadowaki (For his work on JET.jl and the Julia compiler)

It is an incredibly tough job to pick just three awards each year as there are so many deserving people in the Julia community.

# JuMP-dev 2022

We were excited to have the JuMP-dev conference co-located within JuliaCon for the second time this year. It was another awesome opportunity to get the users and developers from the JuMP community engaged with the greater Julia community. The list of all of the JuMP-dev talks, along with links to their YouTube videos, is available on the [JuMP-dev webpage](https://jump.dev/meetings/juliacon2022/).

# State of Julia

This year, Jeff Bezanson presented the State of Julia talk on behalf of the core Julia development team. The talk covered many of the new compiler developments, language features, and Jeff shared a roadmap for some of the future initiatives the core team is working on.

# Julia User & Developer Survey

This year's 4th annual Julia User and Developer survey captured the thoughts of 1,162 members of the community with the survey being available in English, Spanish, and Japanese.

# Wrapping up

JuliaCon 2022 was yet another amazing event for the community and ecosystem to come together (albeit virtually).

Thank you to all of the amazing speakers, volunteers, organizations, and the entire Julia community for making this year's conference a success. It truly does take a community to put on JuliaCon!
