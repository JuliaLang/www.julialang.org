# Foreword

Exactly 10 years ago, today, on this very blog, we published "Why We Created Julia", introducing the Julia project to the world. 10 years on, Julia has met the ambitious goals set out in the original blog post and from vaccines over climate modeling, material science, macroeconomics, and many leading edge scientific collaborations, the Julia community today is at the forefront of human discovery. Lines of code in a git repository give an open source project form, but a community gives it life. We continue to be impressed every day by the breadth of knowledge and kindness of spirit of the many members our community. Because of that, we wanted to give this space to them. Below we collate the stories of some of the members of the Julia community (both old and new) in a shared reflection on the past 10 years of Julia.


## Keno Fischer

Ten years ago, when "Why we created Julia" was published, I was just finishing my senior year of high school as an exchange student at a tiny school on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. With some painful memories of attempting school projects and online courses in Octave, college acceptance in hand and not much else to do, I resonated strongly with the need for better tools in computational science and started working on Julia that very day. 10 years, there has been hardly a day in the past decade that I did not work on Julia. In this time I've worked on everything from astronomy, over homomorphic encryption, to simulating semiconductors and much in between. There have been many memorable events along the way. For example, 5 years ago, in a first for a dynamic language, we pushed Julia over the Petaflop barrier (a feat that is be much easier now ;) ) running more than a million simultaneous threads of Julia on one of the worlds' largest computers. Every year, I look forward to JuliaCon to get together with the friends I've made along the way and admire how far we've come from the tiny group of people hacking away in a conference room at MIT. It's been a wild 10 years, and things are only getting more exciting.

## Chris Rackauckas

I came rather late to the scene, around 2016. I had written GUIs in R, libraries in Python and MATLAB, handled MEX files and wrote my MPI using C. I wrote some ODE solvers using Fortran like a good ol' kid. I did my due diligence. It was an absolute mess, especially being a Windows user, and so when I found Julia I was astonished to find something that would actually work. No more SciPy installation error from some compiler missing on Windows: Julia was the compiler. And more and more, Julia is the compiler. It was wild when everything was new. In those early days of v0.5-beta I remember creating the Plots.jl and the Juno IDE documentation as trades for getting bug fixes. And from all of that experience in the "wild west", my experience with language and computation had changed. Before, I was thinking language was fixed and it's the differential equation solvers that were "my" work, but with Julia everything opened up. Is the implementation of generating random Poisson numbers fast enough, or for this use case is there something faster than hits the statistical tolerance that I needed? Well that code is in Julia, so let's take a look. Having everything in one language soon meant the world expanded to thinking about how every floating point operation could be optimized for the application at hand. Everything that was taken for granted was now in the hands of the domain. There are so many places in math that are simply untouched because they sound like the domain of a compilers instead of "computational science", and I'm excited to see how the next 10 years bridges this gap in Julia.
