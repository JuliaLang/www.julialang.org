This year, 2,565 Julia users and developers participated in the second annual Julia User and Developer Survey - up from 1,844 participants last year. This year, the survey was administered in 4 languages: English, Spanish, Chinese and German.


The survey was presented during JuliaCon, and highlights are included below. The [slides](/assets/2020-julia-user-developer-survey.pdf) are available for download.


## Who Are Julia Users and Developers?


* Survey respondents come from 102 countries and regions and speak 64 different languages
   * 20% from the United States, 7% from Germany, 6% from India, 4% from France, and the remainder from 98 other countries and regions
   * 91% are fluent in English, 14% are fluent in German, 13% are fluent in French, 11% are fluent in Chinese, 11% are fluent in Spanish, and more than 50% speak another language
* More than 70% are under age 45 and more than two-thirds have less than 15 years of work experience
* 60% are academics and 43% are professionals (survey respondents can be both academics and professionals)


## Who Is Using Julia in Production?


22% of professionals who have used Julia for more than 6 months use Julia in production for a business critical task and 22% use Julia for development as part of a team. 34% use Julia either in production for a business critical task or for development as part of a team.


## What’s Changed Since Last Year?


* 81% of respondents say the Julia community is ‘very’ (55% - up from 47% last year) or ‘somewhat’ (26%) helpful and collaborative.


## How are New Julia Users Different?


* New Julia users still use Python a lot (61% use Python ‘a great deal’) while users with more Julia experience use Python much less (43% use Python ‘a great deal’).


## What Else Did We Learn?


* Among Julia users and developers, the next most frequently used languages after Julia are Python, and Bash/Shell/PowerShell
* If not for Julia, Julia users would be using C++, MATLAB, R, C, Fortran, Bash/Shell/PowerShell and Mathematica
* Most Julia users started using Julia in the last 2-3 years
* Nearly half of Julia users and developers use Julia for at least half their work


## What Do Julia Users and Developers Like Most / Least About Julia?


Julia users and developers most appreciate Julia’s speed and performance, ease of use, open source, MIT license and the community of Julia developers.


From 2019 to 2020, there was an increase in the percentage of respondents looking for reduced compile times and time to first plot, and a decrease in the share of respondents who say that Julia doesn’t have all the packages they need, or that those packages aren’t mature or well-maintained enough.
