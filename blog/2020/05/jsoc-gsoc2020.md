This summer, the Julia Language will be hosting students through GSoC and JSoC. You can read more about this by checking out [our Discourse post](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-seasons-of-contributions-to-supplement-gsoc-2020/38754). We are very excited to have 25 students working with us. Here are the projects they will be working on:
