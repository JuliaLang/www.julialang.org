    <h1>An invitation to JuliaCon 2016</h1>

    <p class="metadata">
      <span class="timestamp">08 May, 2016</span>
      
      &nbsp;|&nbsp;
      <span class="author">The JuliaCon organisers</span>
      
    </p>

    <p><em>For the third year in row we are happy to invite you to <a href="http://juliacon.org/">JuliaCon</a>,
the annual meeting of the Julia programming language community.
JuliaCon 2016 will be held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from
June 21st to 25th and as a first, this year we will have several high-profile
keynote speakers, as well as the top-notch tutorials and talks you have come to
expect over the years.
Please <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/juliacon-2016-tickets-20943697162?ref=ebtnebregn">purchase your tickets</a> before May 13th to take advantage of the
early-bird pricing and we look forward to seeing you in June!</em></p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://juliacon.org/">JuliaCon</a>, just like the Julia language, has come a long way over
the last three years.
In 2014 we were roughly 75 attendees meeting in a medium-sized conference room
at the University of Chicago to great success, in 2015 we had about 225
attendees and enough content to cover four full days at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and this year we hope that you will join us for the
greatest JuliaCon yet!</p>

<p>From June 21st to the 25th JuliaCon 2016 will be held at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, for a full five days of Julia-related content.
On Tuesday 21st we will hold several <a href="http://juliacon.org/2016/workshops.html">workshops</a>, on topics ranging
from intermediate Julia programming to more advanced topics such as writing
high-performance and parallel programming.
From Wednesday 22nd to Friday 24th we will start each day with a keynote by a
high-profile speaker, followed by <a href="http://juliacon.org/2016/abstracts.html">talks</a> on a great variety of subjects:
macro economics, machine learning, astrophysics, visualisation, and more!
On Saturday 25th, the final day of the conference, we will hold a hackathon
where attendees are encouraged to team up based on personal interests to either
create new Julia projects or contribute to existing ones. All these details are
now in the <a href="https://juliacon.org/2016/pdf/juliacon2016poster3.pdf">JuliaCon poster</a>.</p>

<p>Without further ado, please allow us to introduce our keynote speakers:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Timothy E. Holy</strong> is an Associate Professor of Neuroscience at Washington
University in St. Louis.
In 2009 he received the NIH Director’s Pioneer award for innovations in
optics and microscopy.
His lab, which studies how the brain detects pheromones and develops new
optical methods for imaging neuronal activity, was one of the first to adopt
Julia for scientific research.
He is a long time Julia contributor and a lead developer of Julia’s
multidimensional array capabilities as well as the author of far too many
Julia packages.</li>
<li><strong>Thomas J. Sargent</strong> is a Professor of Economics at New York University and
Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution.
In 2011 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded him the Nobel Memorial
Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on macroeconomics.
Together with John Stachurski, he founded quant-econ.net, a Julia and Python
based learning platform for quantitative economics focusing on algorithms
and numerical methods for studying economic problems as well as coding
skills.</li>
<li><strong>Guy L. Steele, Jr.</strong> is a Software Architect for Oracle Labs and Principal
Investigator of the Programming Language Research project.
In 1994, he was made a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery
after receiving the Grace Murray Hopper Award in 1988.
He is an experienced designer of programming languages, like Scheme,
Fortress and Java, and many of his ideas have had an impact on the design
of Julia.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope that our invitation entices you to join us &ndash; new, intermediate, and
experienced Julia users &ndash; for five days of fun at MIT this June and remember to
<a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/juliacon-2016-tickets-20943697162?ref=ebtnebregn">purchase your tickets</a> before May 13th to receive a 33% early-bird
discount!</p>

<hr />

<p>We need your help to spread this message far and wide! Post the
<a href="https://juliacon.org/2016/pdf/juliacon2016poster3.pdf">JuliaCon poster</a> and
this blog post to your local email lists. Print the poster and post it
on your local message board. In addition, please tweet, retweet, post
on FaceBook and LinkedIn and other social media. This is the biggest
JuliaCon ever, and we need your help in making it a huge success.</p>
