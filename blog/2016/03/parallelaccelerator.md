The High Performance Scripting team at Intel Labs recently released
[ParallelAccelerator.jl](https://github.com/IntelLabs/ParallelAccelerator.jl),
a Julia package for high-performance, high-level
[array-style programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming).
The goal of ParallelAccelerator is to make high-level array-style
programs run as efficiently as possible in Julia, with a minimum of
extra effort required from the programmer.  In this post, we'll take a
look at the ParallelAccelerator package and walk through some examples
of how to use it to speed up some typical array-style programs in
Julia.

## Introduction

Ideally, high-level array-style Julia programs should run as
efficiently as possible on high-performance parallel hardware, with a
minimum of extra programmer effort required, and with performance
reasonably close to that of an expert implementation in C or C++.
There are three main things that ParallelAccelerator does to move us
toward this goal:

* First, we identify *implicit parallel patterns* in array-style
  code the user writes.  We'll say more about these parallel
  patterns shortly.
* Second, we compile these parallel patterns to explicit parallel
  loops.
* Third, we *minimize runtime overheads* incurred by things like
  array bounds checks and intermediate array allocations.

The key user-facing feature that the ParallelAccelerator package
provides is a Julia macro called `@acc`, which is short for
"accelerate".  Annotating functions or blocks of code with `@acc` lets
you designate the parts of your Julia program that you want to compile
to optimized native code.  Here's a toy example of using `@acc` to
annotate a function:

```julia
julia> using ParallelAccelerator

julia> @acc f(x) = x .+ x .* x
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f([1,2,3,4,5])
5-element Array{Int64,1}:
2
6
12
20
30
```

Under the hood, ParallelAccelerator is essentially a compiler -- itself implemented in Julia -- that
intercepts the usual Julia JIT compilation process for
`@acc`-annotated functions.  It compiles `@acc`-annotated code to C++
OpenMP code, which can then be compiled to a native library by an
external C++ compiler such as GCC or ICC.
(This intermediate C++ generation step isn't essential to the design
of ParallelAccelerator, though -- instead, the compiler could target
Julia's own forthcoming native threading backend. [[1](#footnote1)])
On the
Julia side, ParallelAccelerator generates a *proxy function* that
calls into that native library, and replaces calls to `@acc`-annotated
functions, like `f` in the above example, with calls to the
appropriate proxy function.

We'll say more shortly about the parallel patterns that
ParallelAccelerator targets and about how the ParallelAccelerator
compiler works, but before we do, let's look at some code and some
performance results.

## A quick preview of results: Black-Scholes option pricing benchmark

Let's see how to use ParallelAccelerator to speed up a classic
high-performance computing benchmark: an implementation of the
[Black-Scholes formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_model)
for option pricing.  The following code is a Julia implementation of
the Black-Scholes formula.

```julia
function cndf2(in::Array{Float64,1})
    out = 0.5 .+ 0.5 .* erf(0.707106781 .* in)
    return out
end

function blackscholes(sptprice::Array{Float64,1},
                      strike::Array{Float64,1},
                      rate::Array{Float64,1},
                      volatility::Array{Float64,1},
                      time::Array{Float64,1})
    logterm = log10(sptprice ./ strike)
    powterm = .5 .* volatility .* volatility
    den = volatility .* sqrt(time)
    d1 = (((rate .+ powterm) .* time) .+ logterm) ./ den
    d2 = d1 .- den
    NofXd1 = cndf2(d1)
    NofXd2 = cndf2(d2)
    futureValue = strike .* exp(- rate .* time)
    c1 = futureValue .* NofXd2
    call = sptprice .* NofXd1 .- c1
    put  = call .- futureValue .+ sptprice
end

function run(iterations)
    sptprice   = Float64[ 42.0 for i = 1:iterations ]
    initStrike = Float64[ 40.0 + (i / iterations) for i = 1:iterations ]
    rate       = Float64[ 0.5 for i = 1:iterations ]
    volatility = Float64[ 0.2 for i = 1:iterations ]
    time       = Float64[ 0.5 for i = 1:iterations ]

    tic()
    put = blackscholes(sptprice, initStrike, rate, volatility, time)
    t = toq()
    println("checksum: ", sum(put))
    return t
end
```

Here, the `blackscholes` function takes five arguments, each of which
is an array of `Float64`s.  The `run` function initializes these five
arrays and passes them to `blackscholes`, which, along with the
`cndf2` (cumulative normal distribution) function that it calls, does
several computations involving pointwise addition (`.+`), subtraction
(`.-`), multiplication (`.*`), and division (`./`) on the arrays.
It's not necessary to understand the details of the Black-Scholes
formula; the important thing to notice about the code is that we are
doing lots of pointwise array arithmetic.  Using Julia 0.4.4-pre on
a 4-core Ubuntu 14.04 desktop machine with 8 GB of memory, the `run`
function takes about 11 seconds to run when called with an argument
of 40,000,000 (meaning that we are dealing with 40-million-element
arrays):

```julia
julia> @time run(40_000_000)
checksum: 8.381928525856283e8
 12.885293 seconds (458.51 k allocations: 9.855 GB, 2.95% gc time)
11.297714183
```

Here, the `11.297714183` being returned from `run` is the number of
seconds it takes the `blackscholes` call alone to return.  The
`12.885293` seconds reported by `@time` is a little longer, because
it's the running time of the entire `run` call.

The many pointwise array operations in this code make it a great
candidate for speeding up with ParallelAccelerator (as we'll discuss
more shortly).  Doing so requires only minor changes to the code: we
import the ParallelAccelerator library with `using
ParallelAccelerator`, then wrap the `cndf2` and `blackscholes`
functions in an `@acc` block, as follows:

```julia
using ParallelAccelerator

@acc begin

function cndf2(in::Array{Float64,1})
    out = 0.5 .+ 0.5 .* erf(0.707106781 .* in)
    return out
end

function blackscholes(sptprice::Array{Float64,1},
                      strike::Array{Float64,1},
                      rate::Array{Float64,1},
                      volatility::Array{Float64,1},
                      time::Array{Float64,1})
    logterm = log10(sptprice ./ strike)
    powterm = .5 .* volatility .* volatility
    den = volatility .* sqrt(time)
    d1 = (((rate .+ powterm) .* time) .+ logterm) ./ den
    d2 = d1 .- den
    NofXd1 = cndf2(d1)
    NofXd2 = cndf2(d2)
    futureValue = strike .* exp(- rate .* time)
    c1 = futureValue .* NofXd2
    call = sptprice .* NofXd1 .- c1
    put  = call .- futureValue .+ sptprice
end

end
```

The definition of `run` stays the same.  With the addition of the
`@acc` wrapper, we now have much better performance:

```julia
julia> @time run(40_000_000)
checksum: 8.381928525856283e8
  4.010668 seconds (1.90 M allocations: 1.584 GB, 2.06% gc time)
3.503281464
```

This time, `blackscholes` returns in about 3.5 seconds, and the entire
`run` call finishes in about 4 seconds.  This is already an
improvement, but on subsequent calls to `run`, we do even better:

```julia
julia> @time run(40_000_000)
checksum: 8.381928525856283e8
  1.418709 seconds (158 allocations: 1.490 GB, 8.98% gc time)
1.007861068

julia> @time run(40_000_000)
checksum: 8.381928525856283e8
  1.410865 seconds (154 allocations: 1.490 GB, 7.93% gc time)
1.012813958
```

In subsequent calls, `run` finishes in about a second, with the entire
call taking about 1.4 seconds.  The reason for this additional
improvement is that ParallelAccelerator has already compiled the
`blackscholes` and `cndf2` functions and doesn't need to do so again
on subsequent runs.

These results were collected on
an ordinary desktop machine, but we can scale up further.  The
following figure reports the time it takes `blackscholes` to run on
arrays of 100 million elements, this time on a 36-core machine with
128 GB of RAM [[2](#footnote2)]:

![Benchmark results for plain Julia and ParallelAccelerator implementations of the Black-Scholes formula](/assets/blog/parallelaccelerator_figures/black-scholes-2016-01-31-blogpost.png?raw=true)

The first three bars of the above figure show performance results for
ParallelAccelerator using different numbers of threads.  Since
ParallelAccelerator compiles Julia to OpenMP C++, we can use the
`OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable to control the number of
threads that the code runs with.  Here, with `OMP_NUM_THREADS` set to
18, `blackscholes` runs in 0.27 seconds; with 36 threads (matching the
number of cores on the machine), running time drops to 0.16 seconds.
The third bar shows results for ParallelAccelerator with
`OMP_NUM_THREADS` set to 1, which clocks in at about 3 seconds. For
comparison, the rightmost bar show results for "plain Julia", that is,
a version of the code without `@acc`, which runs in about 21 seconds.

Because Julia doesn't (yet) have native multithreading support, the
plain Julia results shown in the rightmost bar are for one thread.
But it is interesting to note that the ParallelAccelerator
implementation of Black-Scholes outperforms plain Julia by a factor of
about seven, even when running on just one core.  The reason for this
speedup is that ParallelAccelerator (despite its name!) does more than
just parallelize code.  The ParallelAccelerator compiler is able to do
away with much of the runtime overhead incurred by array bounds checks
and allocation of intermediate arrays.  After that, with the addition
of parallelism, we're able to do even better, for a total speedup of
more than 100x over plain Julia.

To see how ParallelAccelerator accomplishes this, we'll discuss the
parallel patterns that ParallelAccelerator handles in a bit more
detail, and then we'll take a closer look at the ParallelAccelerator
compiler pipeline.

## Parallel patterns

ParallelAccelerator works by identifying implicit parallel patterns in
source code and making the parallelism explicit.  These patterns
include *map*, *reduce*, *array comprehension*, and *stencil*.

### Map

As we saw in the Black-Scholes example above, the `.+`, `.-`, `.*`,
and `./` operations in Julia are pointwise array operations that take
input arrays as arguments and produce an output array.
ParallelAccelerator translates these pointwise array operations into
data-parallel *map* operations.  (See
[the ParallelAccelerator documentation](https://parallelacceleratorjl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/advanced.html#map-and-reduce)
for a complete list of all the pointwise array operations that it
knows how to parallelize.)  Furthermore, ParallelAccelerator
translates array assignments into *in-place* map operations.  For
instance, assigning `a = a .* b` where `a` and `b` are arrays would
map `.*` over `a` and `b` and update `a` in place with the result.
For both standard map and in-place map, it is possible for
ParallelAccelerator to avoid any array bounds checking once we've
established that the input arrays and the output arrays are the same
size.

### Reduce

Reduce operations take an array argument and produce a scalar result
by combining all the elements of an array with an associative and
commutative operation.  ParallelAccelerator translates the Julia
functions `minimum`, `maximum`, `sum`, `prod`, `any`, and `all` into
data-parallel reduce operations when they are called on arrays.

### Array comprehension

Julia supports
[array comprehensions](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v0.4/manual/arrays/#comprehensions),
a convenient and concise way to construct arrays.  For example, the
expressions that initialize the five input arrays in the Black-Scholes
example above are all array comprehensions.  As a more sophisticated
example, the following `avg` function, taken from
[the Julia manual](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v0.4/manual/arrays/#comprehensions),
takes a one-dimensional input array `x` of length *n* and uses an
array comprehension to construct an output array of length *n*-2, in
which each element is a weighted average of the corresponding element
in the original array and its two neighbors:

```
avg(x) = [ 0.25*x[i-1] + 0.5*x[i] + 0.25*x[i+1] for i = 2:length(x) - 1 ]
```

Comprehensions like this one can also be parallelized by ParallelAccelerator: in a nutshell, ParallelAccelerator can transform array comprehensions to code that first allocates an output array and then performs an in-place map that can write to each element of the output array in parallel.

Array comprehensions differ from map and reduce operations in that
they involve explicit array indexing.  But it is still possible to
parallelize array comprehensions in Julia, as long as there are no
side effects in the comprehension body (everything before the
`for`). [[3](#footnote3)] ParallelAccelerator uses a conservative
static analysis to try to identify and reject side-effecting
operations in comprehensions.

### Stencil

In addition to map, reduce, and comprehension, ParallelAccelerator
targets a fourth parallel pattern:
[stencil computations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stencil_code).  A
stencil computation updates the elements of an array according to a
fixed pattern called a stencil.  In fact, the `avg` comprehension
example above could also be thought of as a stencil computation,
because it updates the contents of an array based on each element's
neighbors.  However, stencil computations differ from the other
patterns that ParallelAccelerator targets, because there's not a
built-in, user-facing language feature in Julia that expresses stencil
computations specifically.  So, ParallelAccelerator introduces a new
user-facing language construct called `runStencil` for expressing
stencil computations in Julia.  Next, we'll look at an example that
illustrates how `runStencil` works.

## Example: Blurring an image with runStencil

Let's consider a stencil computation that blurs an image using a
[Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur).  The
image is represented as a two-dimensional array of pixels.  To blur
the image, we set the value of each output pixel to a particular
weighted average of the corresponding input pixel's value and the
values of its neighboring input pixels.  By repeating this process
multiple times, we can get an increasingly blurred
image. [[4](#footnote4)]

The following code implements a Gaussian blur in Julia.  It operates
on a 2D array of `Float32`s: the pixels of the source image.  It's
easy to obtain such an array using, for instance, the `load` function
from the [Images.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Images.jl) library,
followed by a call to
[`convert`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v0.4/manual/conversion-and-promotion/#conversion)
to get an array of type `Array{Float32,2}`.  (For simplicity, we're
assuming that the input image is a grayscale image, so each pixel has
just one value instead of red, green, and blue values.  However, it
would be straightforward to use the same approach for RGB pixels.)

```julia
function blur(img::Array{Float32,2}, iterations::Int)
    w, h = size(img)
    for i = 1:iterations
      img[3:w-2,3:h-2] =
           img[3-2:w-4,3-2:h-4] * 0.0030 + img[3-1:w-3,3-2:h-4] * 0.0133 + img[3:w-2,3-2:h-4] * 0.0219 + img[3+1:w-1,3-2:h-4] * 0.0133 + img[3+2:w,3-2:h-4] * 0.0030 +
           img[3-2:w-4,3-1:h-3] * 0.0133 + img[3-1:w-3,3-1:h-3] * 0.0596 + img[3:w-2,3-1:h-3] * 0.0983 + img[3+1:w-1,3-1:h-3] * 0.0596 + img[3+2:w,3-1:h-3] * 0.0133 +
           img[3-2:w-4,3+0:h-2] * 0.0219 + img[3-1:w-3,3+0:h-2] * 0.0983 + img[3:w-2,3+0:h-2] * 0.1621 + img[3+1:w-1,3+0:h-2] * 0.0983 + img[3+2:w,3+0:h-2] * 0.0219 +
           img[3-2:w-4,3+1:h-1] * 0.0133 + img[3-1:w-3,3+1:h-1] * 0.0596 + img[3:w-2,3+1:h-1] * 0.0983 + img[3+1:w-1,3+1:h-1] * 0.0596 + img[3+2:w,3+1:h-1] * 0.0133 +
           img[3-2:w-4,3+2:h-0] * 0.0030 + img[3-1:w-3,3+2:h-0] * 0.0133 + img[3:w-2,3+2:h-0] * 0.0219 + img[3+1:w-1,3+2:h-0] * 0.0133 + img[3+2:w,3+2:h-0] * 0.0030
    end
    return img
end
```

Here, to compute the value of a pixel in the output image, we use the
the corresponding input pixel as well as all its neighboring pixels,
to a depth of two pixels out from the input pixel -- so, twenty-four
neighbors.  In all, there are twenty-five pixel values to examine.  We
add all these pixel values together, each multiplied by a weight -- in
this case `0.0030` for the cornermost pixels, `0.1621` for the center
pixel, and for all the other pixels, something in between -- and the
total is the value of the output pixel.  At the borders of the image,
we don't have enough neighboring pixels to compute an output pixel
value, so we simply skip those pixels and don't assign to
them. [[5](#footnote5)]

Notice that the `blur` function explicitly loops over the number of
iterations, that is, times to apply the blur to the the image, but it
does not explicitly loop over pixels in the image.  Instead, the code
is written in array style: it performs just one assignment to the
array `img`, using the ranges `3:w-2` and `3:h-2` to avoid assigning
to the borders of the image.  On a
[large grayscale input image](https://github.com/IntelLabs/ParallelAccelerator.jl/blob/master/examples/example.jpg)
of 7095 by 5322 pixels, this code takes about 10 minutes to run for
100 iterations.

Using ParallelAccelerator, we can get much better performance.  Let's look at a version of `blur` that uses `runStencil`:

```julia
@acc function blur(img::Array{Float32,2}, iterations::Int)
    buf = Array(Float32, size(img)...)
    runStencil(buf, img, iterations, :oob_skip) do b, a
       b[0,0] =
            (a[-2,-2] * 0.003  + a[-1,-2] * 0.0133 + a[0,-2] * 0.0219 + a[1,-2] * 0.0133 + a[2,-2] * 0.0030 +
             a[-2,-1] * 0.0133 + a[-1,-1] * 0.0596 + a[0,-1] * 0.0983 + a[1,-1] * 0.0596 + a[2,-1] * 0.0133 +
             a[-2, 0] * 0.0219 + a[-1, 0] * 0.0983 + a[0, 0] * 0.1621 + a[1, 0] * 0.0983 + a[2, 0] * 0.0219 +
             a[-2, 1] * 0.0133 + a[-1, 1] * 0.0596 + a[0, 1] * 0.0983 + a[1, 1] * 0.0596 + a[2, 1] * 0.0133 +
             a[-2, 2] * 0.003  + a[-1, 2] * 0.0133 + a[0, 2] * 0.0219 + a[1, 2] * 0.0133 + a[2, 2] * 0.0030)
       return a, b
    end
    return img
end
```

Here, we again have a function called `blur` -- now annotated with
`@acc` -- that takes the same arguments as the original code.  This
version of `blur` allocates a new 2D array called `buf` that is the
same size as the original `img` array.  The allocation of `buf` is
followed by a call to `runStencil`.  Let's take a closer look at the
`runStencil` call.

`runStencil` has the following signature:

```julia
runStencil(kernel :: Function, buffer1, buffer2, ..., iteration :: Int, boundaryHandling :: Symbol)
```

In `blur`, the call to `runStencil` uses Julia's
[`do`-block syntax for function arguments](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v0.4/manual/functions/#do-block-syntax-for-function-arguments),
so the `do b, a ... end` block is actually the first argument to the
`runStencil` call.  The `do` block creates an anonymous function that
binds the variables `b` and `a`.  The arguments `buffer1, buffer2,
...` that are passed to `runStencil` become the arguments to the
anonymous function.  In this case, we are passing two buffers, `buf`
and `img`, to `runStencil`, and so the anonymous function takes two
arguments.

Aside from the anonymous function and the two buffers, `runStencil`
takes two other arguments.  The first of these is a number of
iterations that we want to run the stencil computation for.  In this
case, we simply pass along the `iterations` argument that is passed to
`blur`.  Finally, the last argument to `runStencil` is a symbol
indicating how stencil boundaries are to be handled.  Here, we're
using the `:oob_skip` symbol, short for "out-of-bounds skip".  It
means that when input indices are out of bounds -- for instance, in
the situation where the input pixel is one of those on the two-pixel
border of the image, and there aren't enough neighbor pixels to
compute the output pixel value -- then we simply skip writing to the
output pixel.  This has the same effect as the careful indexing in the
original version of `blur`.

Finally, let's look at the body of the `do` block that we're passing
to `runStencil`.  It contains an assignment to `b`, using values
computed from `a`.  As we've said, `b` and `a` here are `buf` and
`img`: our newly-allocated buffer, and the original image.  The code
here is similar to that of the original implementation of `blur`, but
here we're using *relative* rather than absolute indexing into arrays,
The index `0,0` in `b[0,0]` doesn't refer to any particular element of
`b`, but instead to the current position of a cursor that can be
thought of as traversing all the elements of `b`.  On the right side
of the assignment.  `a[-2,-1]` refers to the element in `a` that is
two elements to the left and one element up from the `0,0` element of
`a`.  In this way, we can express a stencil computation more concisely
than the original version of `blur` did, and we don't have to worry
about getting the indices correct for boundary handling as we had to
do before, because the `:oob_skip` argument tells `runStencil`
everything it needs to no to handle boundaries correctly.

Finally, at the end of the `do` block, we return `a, b`.  They were
bound as `b, a`, but we return them in the opposite order so that for
each iteration of the stencil, we'll be using the already-blurred
buffer as the input for another round of blurring.  This continues for
however many iterations we've specified.  There's therefore no need to
write an explicit `for` loop for stencil iterations when using
`runStencil`; one just passes an argument saying how many iterations
should occur.

Therefore `runStencil` enables us to write more concise code than
plain Julia, as we'd expect from a language extension.  But where
`runStencil` really shines is in the performance it enables.  The
following figure compares performance results for plain Julia and
ParallelAccelerator implementations of `blur`, each running for 100
iterations on the aforementioned 7095x5322 source image, run using the
same machine as for the previous Black-Scholes benchmark.

![Benchmark results for plain Julia and ParallelAccelerator implementations of Gaussian blur](/assets/blog/parallelaccelerator_figures/gaussian-blur-2016-03-02-blogpost.png?raw=true)

The rightmost column shows the results for plain Julia, using the
first implementation of `blur` shown above.  The three columns to the
left show results for the ParallelAccelerator version that uses
`runStencil`.  As we can see, even when running on just one thread,
ParallelAccelerator enables a speedup of about 15x: from about 600
seconds to about 40 seconds.  Running on 36 threads provides a further
parallel speedup of more than 26x, resulting in a total speedup of
nearly 400x over plain single-threaded Julia.

## An overview of the ParallelAccelerator compiler architecture

Now that we've talked about the parallel patterns that
ParallelAccelerator speeds up and seen some code examples, let's take
a look at how the ParallelAccelerator compiler works.

The standard Julia JIT compiler parses Julia source code into the
Julia abstract syntax tree (AST) representation.  It performs type
inference on the AST, then transforms the AST to LLVM IR, and finally
generates native assembly code.  ParallelAccelerator intercepts this
process at the level of the AST.  It introduces new AST nodes for the
parallel patterns we discussed above.  It then does various
optimizations on the resulting AST.  Finally, it generates C++ code
that can be compiled by an external C++ compiler.  The following

As many readers of this blog will know, Julia has good support for
[inspecting and manipulating its own ASTs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v0.4/devdocs/reflection/).
Its built-in `code_typed` function will return the AST of any function
after Julia's type inference has taken place.  This is very convenient
for ParallelAccelerator, which is able to use the output from
`code_typed` as the input to the first pass of its compiler, which is
called "Domain Transformations".  The Domain Transformations pass
produces ParallelAccelerator's *Domain AST* intermediate
representation.

Domain AST is similar to Julia's AST, except it introduces new AST
nodes for parallel patterns that it identifies.  We call these nodes
"domain nodes", collectively.  The Domain Transformations pass
replaces certain parts of the AST with domain nodes.

The Domain Transformations pass is followed by the Parallel
Transformations pass, which replaces domain nodes with "parfor" nodes,
each of which represents one or more nested parallel `for` loops.
Loop fusion also takes place during the Parallel Transformations pass.
We call the result of Parallel Transformations *Parallel
AST*. [[6](#footnote6)]

The compiler hands off Parallel AST code to the last pass of the
compiler, CGen, which generates C++ code and converts parfor nodes
into OpenMP loops.  Finally, an external C++ compiler creates an
executable which is linked to OpenMP and to a small array runtime
component written in C that manages the transfer of arrays back and
forth between Julia and C++.

## Caveats

ParallelAccelerator is still a proof of concept at this stage.  Users
should be aware of two issues that can stand in the way of being able
to make effective use of ParallelAccelerator.  Those issues are,
first, package load time, and second, limitations in what Julia
programs ParallelAccelerator is able to handle.  We discuss each of
these issues in turn.

### Package load time

Because ParallelAccelerator is a large Julia package (it's a compiler,
after all), it takes a long time (perhaps 20 or 25 seconds on a 4-core
desktop machine) for `using ParallelAccelerator` to run.  This long
pause is *not* the time that ParallelAccelerator is taking to compile
your `@acc`-annotated code; it's the time that Julia is taking to
compile ParallelAccelerator itself.  After this initial pause, the
first call to an `@acc`-annotated function will incur a brief
compilation pause (this time from the ParallelAccelerator compiler,
not Julia itself) of perhaps a couple of seconds.  Subsequent calls to
the same function won't incur the compilation pause.

Let's see what these compilation pauses look like in practice.  The
ParallelAccelerator package comes with a collection of
[example programs](https://github.com/IntelLabs/ParallelAccelerator.jl/tree/master/examples)
that print timing information, including the
[Black-Scholes](https://github.com/IntelLabs/ParallelAccelerator.jl/blob/master/examples/black-scholes/black-scholes.jl)
and
[Gaussian blur](https://github.com/IntelLabs/ParallelAccelerator.jl/blob/master/examples/gaussian-blur/gaussian-blur.jl)
examples shown in this post.  All the examples print timing
information for two calls to an `@acc`-annotated function: first a
"warm-up" call with trivial arguments to measure compilation time, and
then a more realistic call.  In the output printed by each example,
timing information for the more realistic call is preceded by the
string `"SELFTIMED"`, while timing information for the warm-up call is
preceded by `"SELFPRIMED"`.  Let's run the Black-Scholes example and
time it using the `time` shell command:

```
$ time julia ParallelAccelerator/examples/black-scholes/black-scholes.jl
iterations = 10000000
SELFPRIMED 1.766323497
checksum: 2.0954821257116848e8
rate = 1.9205394841503927e8 opts/sec
SELFTIMED 0.052068703

real	0m26.454s
user	0m31.027s
sys	0m0.874s
```

Here, we're running Black-Scholes for 10,000,000 iterations on our
4-core desktop machine.  The total wall-clock time of 26.454 seconds
consists mostly of the time it takes for `using ParallelAccelerator`
to run.  Once that's done, Julia reports a `SELFPRIMED` time of about
1.8 seconds, which is dominated by the time it takes for
ParallelAccelerator to compile the `@acc`-annotated code, and finally
the `SELFTIMED` time is about 0.05 seconds for this problem size.

As Julia's compilation speed improves, we expect that
package load time will be less of a problem for ParallelAccelerator.

### Compiler limitations

ParallelAccelerator is able to handle only a limited subset of Julia
language features, and it only supports a limited subset of Julia's
`Base` library functions.  In other words, you cannot yet put an
`@acc` annotation on arbitrary Julia code and expect it to go faster out of
the box.  The examples in this post give an idea of what kinds of
programs are supported currently; for more, check out the
[full collection of ParallelAccelerator examples](https://github.com/IntelLabs/ParallelAccelerator.jl/tree/master/examples).
However, if ParallelAccelerator can't compile some code in an
`@acc`-annotated function, it will simply fall back to running the
function under regular Julia.  So your code will run, regardless of
whether ParallelAccelerator can speed it up.

One reason why an `@acc`-annotated function might fail to compile is
that ParallelAccelerator tries to transitively compile every Julia
function that is called by the `@acc`-annotated function.  So, if an
`@acc`-annotated function makes several Julia library calls,
ParallelAccelerator will attempt to compile those functions as well --
and every Julia function that *they* call, and so on.  If any of the
code in the call chain contains a feature that ParallelAccelerator
doesn't currently support, ParallelAccelerator will fail to compile
the original `@acc`-annotated function.  It is therefore a good idea
to begin by annotating small (but expensive) computational kernels
with `@acc`, rather than wrapping an entire program in an `@acc`
block.  The ParallelAccelerator
[documentation](https://parallelacceleratorjl.readthedocs.org/en/latest/limits.html)
has many more details on which Julia features we don't support and why.

These limitations explain why the kind of performance improvements
that ParallelAccelerator provides aren't already the default in Julia.
Supporting all of Julia would be a major undertaking; however, in many
cases, there's not a fundamental reason why ParallelAccelerator
couldn't support a particular Julia feature or a function in `Base`,
and supporting it is a matter of realizing that it is a problem for
users and putting in the necessary engineering effort to fix it.  So,
when you come across code that ParallelAccelerator can't handle,
please do

## Conclusion

In this post, we've introduced
[ParallelAccelerator.jl](https://github.com/IntelLabs/ParallelAccelerator.jl),
a package for speeding up array-style Julia programs.  It works by
identifying implicit parallel patterns in source code and compiling
them to efficient, explicitly parallel executables, along the way
getting rid of many of the usual overheads of high-level array-style
programming.

ParallelAccelerator is an open source project in its early stages, and
we enthusiastically encourage comments, questions,
[bug reports](https://github.com/IntelLabs/ParallelAccelerator.jl/issues),
and contributions from the Julia community.  We welcome everyone's
participation, and we are especially interested in how
ParallelAccelerator can be used to speed up real-world Julia programs.

~~~<a name="footnote1"></a>[1] ~~~ Starting with Julia 0.5, Julia will have its own
native threading support, which means that ParallelAccelerator can
target Julia's own native threads instead of generating C++ OpenMP
code for parallelism.  We've begun work on implementing a
native-threading-based backend for ParallelAccelerator, but we still
target C++ by default.


~~~<a name="footnote2"></a>[2] ~~~ Detailed machine and benchmarking
specifications: We use a machine with two Intel Xeon E5-2699 v3
processors (2.3 GHz) with 18 physical cores each and 128 GB RAM,
running the CentOS 6.7 Linux distribution.  We use the Intel C++
Compiler (ICC) v15.0.2 with "-O3" for compilation of the generated C++
code.  The Julia version is 0.4.4-pre+26.  The results shown are the
average of three runs (we run each version of a benchmark five times
and discard the first and last runs).


~~~<a name="footnote3"></a>[3] ~~~ In Julia, it is not possible to index into
a comprehension's output array in the body of the comprehension.  (The
`avg` example indexes only into the input array, not the output
array.)  Therefore, it's not necessary to do any bounds checking on
writes to the output array.  However, we still need to bounds-check
reads from the input array (for instance, in the `avg` example, if
we'd written `0.25*x[i-2]`, that would be out of bounds), so we cannot
avoid all array bounds checking for comprehensions in the way that we
can for map operations.


~~~<a name="footnote4"></a>[4] ~~~ In practice, rather than applying
successive Gaussian blurs to an image, we'd probably apply a single,
larger Gaussian blur, which, as
[Wikipedia notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur), is at
least as efficient computationally.  Nevertheless, we'll use it here
as an example of a stencil computation that can be iterated.


~~~<a name="footnote5"></a>[5]~~~ A more sophisticated implementation of
Gaussian blur might do a fancier form of border handling, using only
the pixels it has available at the borders.


~~~<a name="footnote6"></a>[6] ~~~ The names "Domain AST" and "Parallel AST"
are inspired by the Domain IR and Parallel IR of the
[Delite compiler framework](https://ppl.stanford.edu/papers/pact11-brown.pdf).
