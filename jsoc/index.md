# Julia Seasons of Contributions

The Julia Seasons of Contributions (JSoC) are the seasonal programs for funding and/or mentoring students and other developers to contribute to the open source ecosystem. Below are the current programs that the Julia Language is participating in.

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

The Julia organization is a participant in Google Summer of Code.
The Julia organization generally fields a large number of students (&gt;20) mentored by open source developers and university professors at leading institutions from all around the world.
Students who are accepted into this prestigious program are paid a summer stipend to contribute to the open source tooling around Julia and its package ecosystem.

If this sounds like something you would be interested in, head over to the [Projects page](/jsoc/projects/) to see a list of all the available projects.

Check out the [application guidelines](/jsoc/guidelines/) once you have a project in mind.

You can see previous Summer of Code projects at the [Archive page](/jsoc/archive/) and details around the mentoring process on the [Mentors page](/jsoc/mentors/).

## NumFOCUS Small Development Grants

![NumFocus Logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35577566/114047420-87487880-983e-11eb-83f1-2820cfe17942.png)

Semi-quarterly NumFOCUS puts out a call for small development grants.
The Julia language organization puts out a call for proposals from the community for grant proposals.
There are no restrictions on what the funding can be used for. Code development, documentation work, educational, sustainability, and diversity initiatives, or other types of projects are all eligible.
Since only one application can be put in for the Julia project, an internal selection process is used to determine which proposals will be submitted to NumFOCUS.
For examples of grants that were funded in the first round, [previous awards](https://numfocus.org/programs/sustainability#sdg).

Usually, around USD 3,000 - 5,000 is available per proposal.
The total allocated funding from NumFOCUS is around USD 20,000 - 50,000 in previous cycles, meaning that not every project will be able to receive a grant.
This total amount is adjusted depending on the number and quality of proposals.
