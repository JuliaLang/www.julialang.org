# Unifying the [JuliaHeath Organization](https://github.com/JuliaHealth) Documentation Landscape

## About your organization 
> [!Note]
In this section, tell us about your organization or project in a few short paragraphs. What problem does your project solve? Who are your users and contributors? How long has your organization or project been in existence? Give some context to help us understand why funding your proposal would create a positive impact in open source and the world.

The Julia Programming Language is an MIT-licensed high-performance programming language designed for speed, usability, and reproducibility within both scientific and general purpose computing.
Currently the Julia community has over 7,000 registered Julia packages, 35 million+ downloads of Julia, and thousands of contributors worldwide.
Julia's popularity continues to grow thanks to the dedicated community of users and developers who have helped develop several smaller specialty ecosystems within Julia.

In particular, the [JuliaHealth Organization](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/) is one such ecosystem that was originally organized and founded 2020.
It is an organization dedicated to improving healthcare by developing open-source tools to work with a variety of health data and promotes interoperable data standards within the broader health research community.
The community is made up of health researchers, data scientists, software developers, and healthcare professionals who are passionate about using Julia to investigate and improve patient outcomes and promote data-driven decision-making.

Over the past four years, our organization membership has grown to more than 60 members actively working on the dozens of JuliaHealth packages we house.
As the entire JuliaHealth user community comprises more than 250 registered users across the Julia Slack and Julia Zulip instances, niche subecosystems have organically arisen under the JuliaHealth umbrella.
Currently, there are various subecosystems such as the Medical Imaging and the Observational Health subecosystem with more subecosystems beginning to emerge.

## Your project’s problem
> [!Note]
Tell us about the problem your project will help solve. Why is it important to your organization or project to solve this problem?

With JuliaHealth's terrific growth over the years -- both in terms of growth in users, members, and actively maintained packages -- we are beginning to see the need for more unified documentation.
Without this unified documentation, we are seeing:

- User confusion due to the lack of documentation around subecosystems (including both emerging and established subecosystems)

- Developing fragmentation of documentation across packages

- Lack of clarity in how users and developers can compose packages together across JuliaHealth and the broader Julia ecosystem to accomplish research tasks

In some ways, this is a very good place to be in in that we have grown to the point of having these issues.
Users and developers want to engage with the JuliaHealth community, but if we do not provide a more unified documentation approach, we could potentially lose members or new contributors and stagnate our growth.

### Project Impact
- By providing clearer guidance and improving accessibility, we seek to make navigating the different aspects of the JuliaHealth organization seamless and intuitive.
- We envision through participation in GSoD that by developing enhanced and unified documentation, we can assist all community levels within the JuliaHealth ecosystem.
- Additionally, as we construct solutions within JuliaHealth to address the needs we have encountered as a growing organization, we will share our insights to the broader Julia community to illustrate various methods other ecosystems within Julia can adapt to meet growing demand.

## Your project’s scope
> [!Note]
Tell us about what documentation your organization will create, update, or improve. If some work is deliberately not being done, include that information as well. Include a time estimate, and whether you have already identified organization volunteers and a technical writer to work with your project.

Although there are many subecosystems within JuliaHealth, our project will be scoped to specifically the Medical Imaging subecosystem as it has grown mature enough to encounter many of these problems already.
Working on documentation around the Medical Imagining subecosystem will benefit the rest of the JuliaHealth ecosystem as it will provide a roadmap for how other subecosystems can best document themselves and support their users.

To better position the Medical Imaging subecosystem within the JuliaHealth organization, we will first have to do some general documentation improvements to the main JuliaHealth website.
This includes:
- Upgrade website to latest Julia documentation deployment tool
     - DocumenterVitepress.jl may be one target
- Add additional organization details for JuliaHealth overall including:
     - A new landing page for the subecosystems
          - Medical Imaging
          - Observational Health
          - Standards and Interoperability
     - Package breakdown using our pre-existing package listing tool
- Add FAQ or support page
- Define and implement tracking metrics to monitor user engagement and interaction with the platform
     - Using an open source and GDPR compliant technology like GoatCounter
     
Once this initial groundwork is done, we will then address some of the specific core tooling within the Medical Imaging subecosystem.
Due to the modular nature of packages within this subecosystem, we will need to improve documentation across various packages to show what they should be used for, how they integrate with one another, and how to onboard as a potential new contributor:

- Documentation tasks for [MedImage]( https://github.com/JuliaHealth/MedImage.jl)
     - Introduction to the theory of medical imaging formats and spatial metadata 
     - Describe how to load and save image
     - Describe how apply basic transformation using MedImage
- Documentation tasks for [MedEye3d](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/MedEye3d.jl)
     - Write tutorial how to configure window size and amount of space allocated to text
     - Give detailed tutorial describing the possible configurations using TextureSpec objects
     - Add the section with all keyboard shortcuts and print screens showing their effects
     - Describe possible user interactions including:
         - Using tool with REPL for fast debugging, include how to modify and refresh image manually
         - Describe manual interaction of modifiable masks
- Documentation tasks for [MedEval3D](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/MedEval3D.jl)
     - Describe different metrics and what are their strength and weaknesses
     - Make a tutorial showing how to use each metric
- Documentation tasks for [MedPipe3D](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/MedPipe3D.jl)
     - Describe how to use Medpipe functionalities in different use cases
     - Give introduction to the functionalities in development like augmentations, largest component analysis or hyperparameter tuning (without usage examples)

- Documentation tasks for [KomaMRI](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl):
     - Through coordination with the KomaMRI volunteers, [outstanding issues from KomaMRI will be addressed](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Adocumentation)

Finally, if time permits, there will be some additional stretch goals that we would like to attempt accomplishing:
- Page for ongoing projects across JuliaHealth
- Page for research accomplishments within JuliaHealth
- Write a JuliaHealth blog entry on a Medeye topic to broaden project reach

## Measuring your project’s success
> [!Note]
How will you know that your new documentation has helped solve your problem? What metrics will you use, and how will you track them?

Currently, the documentation we do have does not yet have support for documentation traffic analytics.
As of this moment, our best direct source for traffic metrics is to use [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages?q=JuliaHealth/) to monitor package downloads and also to reference GitHub stars for a loose approximation of "discoverability".
Additionally, we take advantage of the [The Julia Programming Language YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheJuliaLanguage) that we use to monitor engagement with our recorded [JuliaHealth Workgroup meetings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP8iPy9hna6QCTkFxfHs2Y4foaYBJAjzO).
In these situations, potential users or contributors would have to know where to look to find these resources or entry points to our supported packages and their respective subecosystems.
#### We would consider the project successful if :

For JuliaHealth, we would consider this project successful if:
- We can readily track documentation traffic across packages
     - Encompasses deploying a safe traffic detection tool
     - Seeing at least a 10 - 15% growth in traffic after the deployment of tracking
- An overall increase by 5 - 10% in traffic across all JuliaHealth platforms
     - Includes JuliaHub, YouTube, GitHub, and documentation statistics
- Most (if not all) enumerated documentation tasks are completed for the Medical Imaging subecosystem
     - Some Related Issue Links:
[Sub-Package Documentation 1](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/MedPipe3D.jl/issues/10)

[Sub-Package Documentation 3](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/MedEye3d.jl/issues/11)
[Sub-Package Documentation 4](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/MedEye3d.jl/issues/9)

- At least 3 - 5 new active JuliaHealth contributors across the JuliaHealth ecosystem are onboarded
     - Tracked across GitHub contribution history
- A new blog post is published

## Timeline
> [!Note]
How long do you estimate this work will take? Are you able to breakdown the tech writer tasks by month/week?

We assume the tech writer will put in part time hours (10-20 hours/week) during this time.
### Monthly Plan

| Dates | Action items |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| May |  Technical writer and volunteers are hired, onboarding  |
| June-July  | Research into Julia community, Audit existing documentation |
| August-September | Create Standard Package Documentations, Medical imaging subecosystem documentation  |
| October |  Improvements to the main page of JuliaHealth |
| November | Write a blog post, Any outstanding tasks or stretch goals |

### Weekly Plan

- **Week (1-2)** - Reading and Familiarization

- **Week (3-4)** - Documentation Traffic Tracker Setup

- **Week (5-7)** - Setting up the environment and Updating Organization Details & Creating Subecosystem Sections

- **Week (8-10)** -  Linking Packages across subecosystems

This timeline is largely accurate but we expect that different packages or tasks may be slightly more challenging than others.
The November time period gives us the opportunity to revisit any unfinished tasks and to potentially explore stretch goals if there were not many outstanding tasks left.

### Communication Plan: 
The primary communication channel we will use is [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) and Dr. Jakub Mitura (MD, PhD) will be the individual responsible for all contact and mentoring throughout the project for regular updates and meetings.
Outside of Slack, email will be used to handle communications with GSoD organizers and administrators with Jakub Mitura's email being: [jakub.mitura14@gmail.com](mailto:jakub.mitura14@gmail.com).
Volunteers will also be available for communication on the Slack on an as-needed basis.
Additionally, project updates will be given through the [Julia Health Slack Channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T68168MUP/C012NN70P5K) which is where the majority of JuliaHealth communication takes place between members, users, and the rest of the Julia community.
