# Project Ideas for 2023

Below you can find a running list of potential GSoD projects. If any of these are of interest to you, please reachout to the respective mentor(s).

## Build Tidier.jl Usage Guides and Core Documentation

Today, there is no clear option for R users to make the transition to Julia. [Tidier.jl](https://github.com/kdpsingh/Tidier.jl) is working to solve this problem by building the entire tidyverse ecosystem from the ground up in Julia. The tidyverse is one of the main reasons developers stick with the R programming language, despite the many benefits of a modern programming language like Julia. We plan to leverage Tidier.jl to usher in the next 1 million Julia users.
