## Machine Learning in Predictive Survival Analysis

Implement survival analysis models for use in the MLJ machine learning
platform.

**Difficulty.** Moderate - hard. **Duration.** 350 hours

### Description

Survival/time-to-event analysis is an important field of Statistics
concerned with understanding the distribution of events over time.
Survival analysis presents a unique challenge as we are also interested
in events that do not take place, which we refer to as 'censoring'.
Survival analysis methods are important in many real-world settings,
such as health care (disease prognosis), finance and economics (risk of
default), commercial ventures (customer churn), engineering (component
lifetime), and many more. This project aims to implement models for
performing survivor analysis with the MLJ machine learning framework.

**Mentors.** [Sebastian Vollmer](https://sebastian.vollmer.ms), [Anthony Blaom](https://ablaom.github.io/),

## Time series forecasting at scale - speed up via Julia

Time series are ubiquitous - stocks, sensor reading, vital signs. This projects aims at adding time series forecasting to MLJ and perform benchmark comparisons to [sktime](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime), [tslearn](https://github.com/rtavenar/tslearn), [tsml](https://github.com/uea-machine-learning/tsml/)).

**Difficulty.** Moderate - hard. **Duration.** 350 hours.

### Prerequisites
- Julia language fluency essential.
- Git-workflow essential
- Some prior contact with time series forecasting
- HPC in julia is a desirable

### Your contribution
MLJ is so far focused on tabular data and time series classification. This project is to add support for time series data in a modular, composable way.

Time series are everywhere in real-world applications and there has been an increase in interest in time series frameworks recently (see e.g. [sktime](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime), [tslearn](https://github.com/rtavenar/tslearn), [tsml](https://github.com/uea-machine-learning/tsml/)).

But there are still very few principled time-series libraries out there, so you would be working on something that could be very useful for a large number of people. To find out more, check out this [paper](http://learningsys.org/neurips19/assets/papers/sktime_ml_systems_neurips2019.pdf) on sktime.

**Mentors**: [Sebastian Vollmer](https://sebastian.vollmer.ms), [Markus Löning](https://github.com/mloning) (sktime developer).

## Interpretable Machine Learning in Julia

Interpreting and explaining black box interpretation crucial to establish trust and improve performance

**Difficulty.** Easy - moderate. **Duration.** 350 hours.

### Description
It is important to have mechanisms in place to interpret the results of machine learning models. Identify the relevant factors of a decision or scoring of a model.

This project will implement methods for model and feature interpretability.

**Mentors.** [Diego Arenas](https://github.com/darenasc), [Sebastian Vollmer](https://sebastian.vollmer.ms).

### Prerequisites
- Julia language fluency essential.
- Git-workflow familiarity strongly preferred.
- Some prior contact with explainable AI/ML methods is desirable.
- A passing familiarity with machine learning goals and workflow preferred

### Your contribution

The aim of this project is to implement multiple  variants implementation algorithms such as:

- Implement methods to show feature importance
- Partial dependence plots
- Tree surrogate
- LocalModel: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations
- Add Dataset loaders for standard interpretability datasets.
- Add performance metrics for interpretability
- Add interpretability algorithms
- Glue code to SHAP package

Specifically you will
- Familiarize yourself with MLJ
- Survey of some of the literature and existing implementations in Julia and other languages, and preparing a short summary

## Model visualization in MLJ

Design and implement a data visualization module for MLJ.

**Difficulty**. Easy.  **Duration.** 350 hours.

### Description

Design and implement a data visualization module for MLJ to visualize numeric and categorical features (histograms, boxplots, correlations, frequencies), intermediate results, and metrics generated by MLJ machines.

Using a suitable Julia package for data visualization.

The idea is to implement a similar resource to what [mlr3viz](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3viz) does for [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com).

### Prerequisites
* Julia language fluency essential.
* Git-workflow essential.
* Some prior work on data visualization is desirable

### Your contribution
So far visualizing data or features in MLJ is an ad-hoc task. Defined by the user case by case. You will be implementing a standard way to visualize model performance, residuals, benchmarks and predictions for MLJ users.

The structures and metrics will be given from the results of models or data sets used; your task will be to implement the right visualizations depending on the data type of the features.

A relevant part of this project is to visualize the target variable against the rest of the features.

You will enhance your visualisation skills as well as your ability to "debug" and understand models and their prediction visually.

## Speed demons only need apply

Diagnose and exploit opportunities for speeding up common MLJ
workflows.

**Difficulty.** Moderate.  **Duration.** 350 hours.

### Description

In addition to investigating a number of known performance bottlenecks, you will have some free reign in this to identify opportunities to speed up common MLJ workflows, as well as making better use of memory resources.

### Prerequisites
- Julia language fluency essential.
- Experience with multi-threading and multi-processor computing essential, preferably in Julia.
- Git-workflow familiarity strongly preferred.
- Familiarity with machine learning goals and  workflow preferred

### Your contribution
In this project you will:
- familiarize yourself with the training, evaluation and tuning of machine learning models in MLJ
- work towards addressing a number of known performance issues, including:

- rolling out new data front-end for models to avoid unnecessary copying of data
- in conjunction with your mentor, identify best design for introducing better sparse data support to MLJ models (e.g., naive Bayes)
- implement multi-processor parallelism in the current learning networks scheduler
