# Documentation tooling

## Documenter.jl

The Julia manual and the documentation for a large chunk of the ecosystem is generated using [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) -- essentially a static site generator that integrates with Julia and its docsystem. There are tons of opportunities for improvements for anyone interested in working on the interface of Julia, documentation and various front-end technologies (web, LaTeX).
