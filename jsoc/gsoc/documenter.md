# Documentation tooling â€“ Summer of Code

## Documenter.jl

The Julia manual and the documentation for a large chunk of the ecosystem is generated using [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) -- essentially a static site generator that integrates with Julia and its docsystem. There are tons of opportunities for improvements for anyone interested in working on the interface of Julia, documentation and various front-end technologies (web, LaTeX).

Here are some features or areas that are looking for contributions:

* User-contributed notes and examples to documentation (e.g. backed by GitHub Discussions).
* One-page-per-function documentation listings (prototype for main Julia manual). See [JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl#2133](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/2133).
* JuliaSyntax-based code highlighter for Julia code that can be re-used for both the HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.
* Rework Documenter's page layout and navigation. See [JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl#2177](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/2177).
* Improve or rework Documenter's search index.
* Work on any of the ideas that have been [marked as plugins](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/labels/Type%3A%20Plugin), as they offer self-contained features to work on.

If any of these sound interesting, please reach out to the mentors to ask for more details and to narrow down the project for a proposal. The possible projects vary in difficulty and size, depending on the project and the ultimate scope.

**Recommended skills**: Depends on the project, but the work would generally involved both Julia programming, but also basic web development (HTML, CSS, JS).

**Mentors:** [Morten Piibeleht](https://github.com/mortenpi), [Fredrik Ekre](https://github.com/fredrikekre)

## Contact

Best way to reach out is to message in the `#documentation` channel on the [JuliaLang Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/)!
