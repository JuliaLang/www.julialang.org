# VS Code projects

## VS Code extension

We are generally looking for folks that want to help with the [Julia VS Code extension](https://www.julia-vscode.org/).
We have a long list of open issues, and some of them amount to significant projects.

**Required Skills**: TypeScript, Julia, web development.

**Expected Results**: Depends on the specific projects we would agree on.

**Mentors**: [David Anthoff](https://github.com/davidanthoff)

## Package installation UI

The VSCode extension for Julia could provide a simple way to browse available packages and view what's installed on a users system. To start with, this project could simply provide a GUI that reads in package data from a `Project.toml`/`Manifest.toml` and show some UI elements to add/remove/manage those packages.

This could also be extended by having metadata about the package, such as a readme, github stars, activity and so on (somewhat similar to the VSCode-native extension explorer).

**Expected Results**: A UI in VSCode for package operations.

**Recommended Skills**: Familiarity with TypeScript and Julia development.
