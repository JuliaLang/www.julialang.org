# JuliaStats Projects – Summer of Code

[JuliaStats](https://github.com/JuliaStats) is an organization dedicated to providing high-quality packages for statistics in Julia.


## Panel data analysis

Implement panel analysis models and estimators in Julia.

**Difficulty.** Moderate. **Duration.** 350 hours

### Description

Panel data is an important kind of statistical data that deals with
observations of multiple units across time. Common examples of panel
data include economic statistics (where it is common to observe
figures for several countries over time). This combination of longitudinal 
and cross-sectional data can be powerful for extracting causal
structure from data.

**Mentors.** [Nils Gudat](https://github.com/nilshg), [José Bayoán Santiago Calderón](https://github.com/Nosferican)

### Prerequisites

-   Must be fluent in at least one language for statistical computing, and 
  willing to learn Julia before the start of projects.

-   Knowledge of basic statistical inference covering topics such as maximum
 likelihood estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. (Must
 know before applying.)

-   Basic familiarity with time series statistics (e.g. ARIMA models, autocorrelations) 
  or panel data. (Can be learned after applying.)


### Your contribution

Participants will:

-   Learn and build on past approaches and packages for panel data analysis,
  such as those in [Econometrics.jl](https://github.com/Nosferican/Econometrics.jl) 
  and [SynthControl.jl](https://github.com/nilshg/SynthControl.jl).

-   Generalize [TreatmentPanels.jl](https://github.com/nilshg/TreatmentPanels.jl) 
  into an abstract interface for dealing with and manipulating panel data.
  
-   Integrate existing estimators provided by packages such as Econometrics.jl 
  into a single package for panel data estimation.

## CRRao.jl

Implement consistent APIs for statistical modeling in Julia. 

**Difficulty.** Easy. **Duration.** 350 hours

### Description

Currently, the Julia statistics ecosystem is quite fragmented. There is 
value in having a consistent API for a wide variety of statistical models. 
The CRRao.jl package offers this design. We have built several models with
this interface, but there is still work to be done here.

**Mentors.** [Sourish Das](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~sourish/)

### Prerequisites

-   Must be fluent in Julia.

-   Knowledge of basic statistical inference covering topics such as maximum
 likelihood estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. (Must
 know before applying.)

### Your contribution

Participants will:

-   Help create, test, and document standard statistical APIs for Julia.


## JuliaStats Improvements 

General improvements to JuliaStats packages, depending on the interests 
of participants.

**Difficulty.** Easy-Hard. **Duration.** 175-350 hours.

### Description

JuliaStats provides many of the most popular packages in Julia, including:
-   StatsBase.jl for basic statistics (e.g. weights, sample statistics,
  moments). 
-   MixedModels.jl for random and mixed-effects linear models.
-   GLM.jl for generalized linear models.
All of these packages are critically important to the Julia statistics
community, and all could be improved.


**Mentors.** Mousum Dutta, [Chirag Anand](https://github.com/chiraganand), [Ayush Patnaik](https://github.com/ayushpatnaikgit), 

### Prerequisites

-   Must be fluent in at least one language for statistical computing, and 
  willing to learn Julia before the start of projects.

-   Knowledge of basic statistical inference covering topics such as maximum
 likelihood estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. (Must
 know before applying.)



### Your contribution

Participants will:

-   Make JuliaStats better! This can include additional estimators,
  new features, performance improvements, or anything else you're
  interested in.
-   StatsBase.jl improvements could include support for cumulants,
  L-moments, or additional estimators.
-   Distributions.jl improvements could include support for new 
  distributions (e.g. elliptical distributions), additional 
  parametrizations and keyword constructors for current 
  distributions, or extending support for distributions of 
  transformed variables.
-   New nonparametric density estimators, e.g. those in R's
  [Locfit](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/locfit/index.html) 
  package.
-   Packages to support survey statistics, similar to R's
  [survey](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survey/index.html)
  package.
