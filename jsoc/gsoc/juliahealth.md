## Observational Health Subecosystem Projects

### Project 1: Supporting Patient Level Prediction Pipelines within JuliaHealth

**Description:** Patient level prediction (PLP) is an important area of research in observational health research that involves using patient data to predict outcomes such as disease progression, response to treatment, and hospital readmissions.
JuliaHealth is interested in developing supportive tooling for PLP that utilizes historical patient data, such as patient medical claims or electronic health records, that follow the OMOP Common Data Model (OMOP CDM), a widely used data standard that allows researchers to analyze large, heterogeneous healthcare datasets in a consistent and efficient manner.
For this project, we are looking for students interested in developing supportive PLP tooling within JuliaHealth.

- **Mentor:** Jacob S. Zelko (aka TheCedarPrince) [email: jacobszelko@gmail.com]

- **Difficulty**: Medium

- **Duration**: 175 hours

- **Suggested Skills and Background**:
  - Experience with Julia
  - Exposure to machine learning concepts and ideas
  - Familiarity with some of the following Julia packages would be a strong asset:
    - DataFrames.jl
    - OMOPCDMCohortCreator.jl
    - MLJ.jl
    - ModelingToolkit.jl
  - Comfort with the OMOP Common Data Model (or a willingness to learn)

- **Outcomes:**

This project will be very experimental and exploratory in nature.
To constrain the expectations for this project, here is a possible approach students will follow while working on this project:

  - Review existing literature on approaches to PLP
  - Familiarize oneself with tools for machine learning and prediction within the Julia ecosystem
  - Develop infrastructure needed for doing PLP within the JuliaHealth ecosystem such as:
      - Consistent DataFrames.jl interface
      - Data harmonization methods
      - Sampling considerations for large scale patient data
  - Document findings and novel software

In whatever functionality that gets developed for tools within JuliaHealth, it will also be expected for students to contribute to the existing package documentation to highlight how new features can be used.
Another perspective of this project is that its intended goal is to provide the foundational support needed within JuliaHealth to better accommodate multiple modalities of data available within public health settings.
The long term goal is to use the development of foundational tooling with JuliaHealth to better support patient level prediction workflows across observational health data and additional information such as survey data, social determinants of health data, and climate data.

Additionally, depending on the success of the package, there is a potential to run experiments on actual patient data to generate actual patient population insights based on a chosen research question.
This could possibly turn into a separate research paper, conference submission, or poster submission.
Whatever may occur in this situation will be supported by project mentors.

# Julia Radiomics

**Project Title:** Julia Radiomics  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Duration:** 375 hours (22 Weeks)  
**Mentor:** Jakub Mitura  

## Description
Radiomic features are quantitative metrics extracted from medical images using data-characterization algorithms. These features capture tissue and lesion characteristics, such as heterogeneity and shape, which may provide valuable insights beyond what the naked eye can perceive.

This project aims to implement algorithms for extracting radiomic features from 2D and 3D medical images, similar to PyRadiomics, using Julia. The implementation will include Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Gray Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM), Gray Level Run Length Matrix (GLRM), Neighborhood Gray Tone Difference Matrix (NGTDM), and Gray Level Dependence Matrix (GLDM). The extracted features will be validated against PyRadiomics and applied to medical imaging data, such as the AutoPET dataset, to demonstrate the methodology. 


## Deliverables

For each point, the mentor will also supply the person responsible for implementation with examples of required functionalities in Python or will point to the Julia libraries already implementing it (that just need to be integrated).


# Project Title: A Digital Twin Approach for Advanced Supervoxel Visualization for Multi-Image View in Medical Imaging

## General Idea
This project aims to develop visualization and interaction software for advanced supervoxel visualization on multi-image views. Building on the experiences from MedEye3D, the project will focus on creating a tool that allows users to interact with and visualize supervoxels across different imaging modalities (e.g., CT and MRI) simultaneously. The software will highlight corresponding supervoxels in different images when the user hovers over them, facilitating reliable analysis even in the presence of natural elastic deformations.

## Potential Outcomes
- **Enhanced Visualization:** A software tool that provides side-by-side views of different imaging studies, displaying supervoxel borders and highlighting corresponding supervoxels across images.
- **Improved Interaction:** An interactive interface allowing users to manually correct supervoxel associations by clicking and highlighting supervoxels in both images.
- **Control Points Annotation:** Support for annotating and displaying control points to aid in registration and user orientation.
- **User Feedback Integration:** Mechanisms for users to indicate incorrect supervoxel associations, improving the reliability of the tool.

## Success Criteria and Time Needed
- **Software Development:** [10 Weeks]
  - Develop the core visualization tool with side-by-side image views.
  - Implement supervoxel border display and highlighting functionality.
  - Integrate control points annotation and display features.
- **User Interaction Features:** [6 Weeks]
  - Develop interactive features for manual correction of supervoxel associations.
  - Implement user feedback mechanisms for indicating incorrect associations.
- **Testing and Validation:** [2 Weeks]
  - Conduct extensive testing with sample medical imaging data.
  - Validate the tool's accuracy and reliability in highlighting corresponding supervoxels.
- **Documentation and User Training:** [2 Weeks]
  - Create comprehensive documentation for the software.
  - Develop training materials and conduct user training sessions.
- **Final Review and Deployment:** [2 Weeks]
  - Review the project outcomes and make necessary adjustments.
  - Deploy the software for use by the scientific community.

The total estimated time for the project is approximately 22 weeks. Success will be measured by the tool's ability to accurately highlight corresponding supervoxels, ease of use, and positive feedback from users in the medical imaging community.

## Technical Requirements and Expected Expertise
- Strong programming skills in Julia/C++
- Experience with medical imaging libraries (ITK, SimpleITK, NIfTI)
- Familiarity with GUI development (preferably ModernGL.jl)
- Understanding of 3D visualization techniques
- Basic knowledge of medical image processing concepts
- Experience with version control (Git)

## Tools and Technologies

- **GUI Framework:** ModernGL.jl/ Vulkan.jl
- **Image Processing:** ITK/SimpleITK
- **Visualization:** OpenGL
- **Building upon:** MedEye3D framework

## User Interaction Examples
- **Hovering Over Supervoxels:** When the user hovers the mouse over a supervoxel in one image (e.g., CT scan), the corresponding supervoxel in the other image (e.g., MRI scan) will be highlighted automatically.
- **Manual Correction:** If the user identifies an incorrect supervoxel association, they can click on the supervoxel in one image to freeze it, then manually find and click the correct supervoxel in the other image to establish the correct association.
- **Control Points:** Users can annotate control points by clicking on corresponding anatomical areas in both images. These points will be saved and displayed to assist in image registration and orientation.

## Importance and Impact
This project is significant because it addresses the challenges of non-rigid registration in medical imaging, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. By providing a reliable tool for visualizing and interacting with supervoxels across different imaging modalities, the project has the potential to:
- Enhance the accuracy of image registration and subsequent measurements.
- Reduce the time required for manual registration by radiologists and nuclear medicine specialists.
- Enable the development of new algorithms and methods in the medical imaging field.
- Improve clinical decision-making by providing more reliable imaging data.

While various medical image visualization tools exist, there is currently no software solution that specifically addresses supervoxel-based visualization across multiple imaging modalities with interactive correction capabilities. This project builds upon MedEye3D as an independent extension, enhancing its capabilities with new features for supervoxel visualization and interaction.

## Visual Examples
