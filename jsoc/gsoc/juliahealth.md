# JuliaHealth Projects 

JuliaHealth is an organization dedicated to improving healthcare by promoting open-source technologies and data standards
Our community is made up of researchers, data scientists, software developers, and healthcare professionals who are passionate about using technology to improve patient outcomes and promote data-driven decision-making
We believe that by working together and sharing our knowledge and expertise, we can create powerful tools and solutions that have the potential to transform healthcare.

## Project Ideas

### Project 1: Expanding OMOP Common Data Model Tooling

- **Difficulty**: Medium

- **Duration**: 175 hours

- **Suggested Skills and Background**: 
    - Background in data analysis
    - Familiarity with the OMOP Common Data Model
    - Experience with Julia

The OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) is a widely used data standard that allows researchers to analyze large, heterogeneous healthcare datasets in a consistent and efficient manner
JuliaHealth has several packages that work with the OMOP CDM, including the OMOP.jl package, which provides a framework for working with OMOP CDM-based data in Julia
For this project, we are looking for a student who is interested in expanding the tooling around the OMOP CDM in Julia
This could involve adding new features to existing packages, creating new packages that work with the OMOP CDM, or improving the documentation and user experience of existing tools.

### Project 2: Developing Patient Level Prediction Tooling
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Duration**: 175 hours
- **Suggested Skills and Background**: 
    - Strong background in machine learning
    - Familiarity with the OMOP Common Data Model
    - Experience with Julia
  Patient level prediction (PLP) is an important area of research in healthcare that involves using patient data to predict outcomes such as disease progression, response to treatment, and hospital readmissions
JuliaHealth is interested in developing tooling for PLP that utilizes data in the OMOP CDM format
For this project, we are looking for a student who is interested in developing PLP tooling within the JuliaHealth organization
This could involve creating new packages that implement state-of-the-art PLP algorithms, improving the performance and scalability of existing tools, or developing new visualization tools to help researchers better understand their results.

### Project 3: Creating a Network Study Using JuliaHealth Tools

- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Duration**: 175 hours
- **Suggested Skills and Background**: 
    - Strong background in data analysis
    - Familiarity with the OMOP Common Data Model
    - Experience with Julia
  A network study is an important type of analysis in the OHDSI ecosystem that involves analyzing relationships between different entities (such as drugs, diseases, and procedures) using observational healthcare data
For this project, we are looking for a student who is interested in creating a network study using tools within the JuliaHealth ecosystem and building out tools as needed to conduct the study
This could involve working with data in the OMOP CDM format, implementing network analysis algorithms, and developing visualization tools to help researchers better understand their results.

## Conclusion

We believe that these projects have the potential to make a significant impact in the healthcare industry by improving the efficiency and accuracy of data analysis and prediction
We are excited to work with talented students who are passionate about healthcare and technology, and we look forward to seeing what they can accomplish during the Google Summer of Code 2023.
