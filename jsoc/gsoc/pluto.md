# Pluto.jl projects

## Pluto as a VS Code notebook

VS Code is an extensible editor, and one of its most recent features is a notebook GUI, with a corresponding [Notebook API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/notebook), allowing extension developers to write their own _notebook backend_. We want to combine two popular Julia IDEs: VS Code and Pluto.jl, and use it to provide a mature editing and debugging experience combined with Pluto's reactivity.

**Expected Results:** Reactive notebook built on top of VSCode's notebook API.

**Recommended skills:** JavaScript/TypeScript, some Julia experience

**Duration:** 175 h

**Mentors:** [Sebastian Pfitzner](https://github.com/pfitzseb) (core maintainer of julia-vscode), [Panagiotis Georgakopoulos](https://github.com/pankgeorg) and [Fons van der Plas](https://github.com/fonsp) (core maintainers of Pluto.jl) and friends

## Tools for education

Pluto's primary use case is education, and we recently started using Pluto notebooks as an 'interactive textbook': https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/ . If you are interested in design and interactive visualization, there are lots of cool JS projects in this area. Examples include:
- Linking video content to dynamic content, better integration between exercise and lecture material.
- Experiment with playing back the edits to a notebook session, like a video, but on a scrollable page. ([link](https://www.notion.so/malyvsen/Replay-notebook-computations-8bcd4787842e40a199806ebe1c368acb)).
- Syntax analysis to automatically review 'code style'
- Improved live check and autograding tools
- And so on! Take a look at our [project board](https://www.notion.so/malyvsen/Pluto-jl-a9982e79b7bb4c658e6216c15a9d4cab) and get in touch if you have further ideas: fons@plutojl.org

**Expected Results:** _One_ of the items above! When finished, your work will be used in future editions of the Computational Thinking course and more!

**Recommended skills:** JavaScript, CSS, you can learn Julia as part of the project.

**Duration:** 175 h

**Mentors:** [Fons van der Plas](https://github.com/fonsp), [Connor Burns](https://github.com/ctrekker) and fellow Pluto.jl maintainers, with feedback from [Alan Edelman](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.php?pid=63)

## Electron app

Right now, [Pluto]() is a *Julia package* with one function, `Pluto.run()`:
```julia
julia> using Pluto
julia> Pluto.run()

Welcome to Pluto! Go to http://localhost:1234/ to start writing!
```

This makes sense, because Pluto is written in Julia! But for many people, the steps *install Julia, open a terminal, run the Julia REPL, use Pkg to install Pluto, import Pluto, run Pluto* are still much too intimidating. Ideally, we hope that Pluto will make scientific computing more accessible and fun for everyone, especially beginner students and programmers who might not have used a terminal before!

For this reason, we want Pluto to be a standalone [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app, just like VS Code, Slack, WhatsApp, GitHub Desktop, Atom, and many others. Pluto as a standalone app opens the door to a more smooth and uniform user experience across the board, through Electron's native file system capabilities, setting the app to open notebook files when double-clicked, and configurable automated updates for both Pluto and Julia.

This project can be broken down into four smaller chunks.
1. Serve Pluto's web files in Electron
2. Get the Electron view talking with a local Pluto server
3. Implement native file system features for Pluto in Electron
4. Package the app into an easily installable binary (exe for Windows, dmg for MacOS, etc.)

**Expected Results:** An Electron app for editing Pluto.jl notebooks, with support for operating system-specific features like file open or double-click. The app should also automatically install Julia if not already installed

**Recommended skills:** JavaScript

**Duration:** 175 h

**Mentors:** [Connor Burns](https://github.com/ctrekker), [Michiel Dral](https://github.com/dralletje), [Fons van der Plas](https://github.com/fonsp) and fellow Pluto.jl maintainers


## Wrapping a Rust HTTP server in Julia

### Introduction
Context: *Pluto is a notebook system written in Julia, which means that it runs an HTTP/WS web server in Julia. We currently use the [HTTP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl) for this, an ambitious project to write an HTTP server and client in pure Julia. While HTTP.jl works well in most scenarios, we still find that Pluto's connection is not always reliable. This is because people use Pluto on such a wide range of systems, with all kinds of network configurations, proxies, firewalls, browser interactions etc.* 

Looking for alternatives, we believe that, instead of using a pure-Julia implementation of HTTP, we should wrap around an existing, high-production web server like [hyper.rs](http://hyper.rs/). Julia has a rich history of wrapping libraries written in C, C++, Python, Go, JS and more, and the package manager has first-class support for external binaries.

### Details

As a participant of this project, you will build on top of the Julia and Rust ecosystems. A potential starting point would be looking at the Deno [http server](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/2dc5dba8baf148a525cbb7987cdad0ba6398c5e4/ext/http/lib.rs) implementation also built on top of hyper.rs.
Initially, the goal would be to start using the [hyper C API](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/ffi/index.html) to interoperate with Julia (there is already a [hyper_jll](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/hyper_jll.jl) package :heart: !!). Depending on the progress, another area of exploration is to investigate rustier tools like [jlrs](https://github.com/Taaitaaiger/jlrs).

**Expected Results:** A prototype of wrapping the `hyper` library in Julia, with a focus on reliability and efficiency, forming the basis of the package.

**Recommended skills:** Rust, some Julia experience, some previous experience with language interoperability or inter-process communication.

**Duration:** 175 h
