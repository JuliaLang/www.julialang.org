# Tooling - Summer of Code

## Automation of testing / performance benchmarking (350 hours)

The Nanosoldier.jl project (and related <https://github.com/JuliaCI/BaseBenchmarks.jl>) tests for
performance impacts of some changes. However, there remains many areas that are not covered (such as
compile time) while other areas are over-covered (greatly increasing the duration of the test for no
benefit) and some tests may not be configured appropriately for statistical power. Furthermore, the
current reports are very primitive and can only do a basic pair-wise comparison, while graphs and
other interactive tooling would be more valuable. Thus, there would be many great projects for a
summer contributor to tackle here!

**Expected Outcomes**: Improvement of Julia's automated testing/benchmarking framework.
**Skills**: Interest in and/or experience with CI systems.
**Difficulty**: Medium
