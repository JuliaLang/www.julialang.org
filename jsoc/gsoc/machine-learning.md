#  Machine Learning Projects - Summer of Code

**Note: FluxML participates as a NumFOCUS sub-organization. Head to [the FluxML GSoC page](http://fluxml.ai/gsoc/) for their idea list.**

### Reinforcement Learning Environments

Time: 175h

Develop a series of reinforcement learning environments, in the spirit of the [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com). Although we have wrappers for the gym available, it is hard to install (due to the Python dependency) and, since it's written in Python and C code, we can't do more interesting things with it (such as differentiate through the environments).

#### Expected Outcome

A pure-Julia version of selected environments that supports a similar API and visualisation options would be valuable to anyone doing RL with Flux.
