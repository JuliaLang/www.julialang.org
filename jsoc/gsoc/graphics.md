#  Graphic Projects â€“ Summer of Code

## Makie

### Improve Documentation + add Examples

[Makie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) is a new plotting library in need of tests and documentation.

One needs to go through all sections of the current documentation, make sure they are understandable and
add examples to the documentation where necessary.
Depending on how much time is left,
there are endless opportunities to create impressive and creative plotting examples
for the example database.

**Expected Results**: greatly improved documentations

**Recommended skills**: Attention to detail and a lot of experience with plotting.

**Mentors**: [Simon Danisch](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/)


### Develop a Cairo/GR/WebVisualize backend

This project involves overloading the [Makie API](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl)
for backends to draw all the different plot types.
You will start with a skeleton from already present backends, so it's about filling the
gaps and making sure all tests pass for the new backend.

**Expected Results**: a fully working new backend to Makie

**Recommended skills**: One should be familiar with a graphics drawing API like Cairo or WebGL for this project.

**Mentors**: [Simon Danisch](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/)


### Port Recipes

[Plots.jl](https://github.com/tbreloff/Plots.jl) offers a lot of [recipes](https://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/recipes/).
In Makie, we will need to make sure that they are available and work correctly.
This project will involve writing a compatibility layer for [PlotRecipes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotRecipes.jl) and then making sure
that all the recipes that are spread around the Julia plotting community work!
**Expected Results**: porting and testing as many recipes as possible
**Recommended skills**: Experience with Plots.jl would be great

## Refactor the GLAbstraction API

We are working on deep refactor of [GLAbstraction](https://github.com/JuliaGL/GLAbstraction.jl), to finally make a fully fledged,
general purpose layer above OpenGL.

The work happens at this [PR](https://github.com/JuliaGL/GLAbstraction.jl/pull/88) and has the following goals:

@@tight-list
* getting rid of Reactive/Color/ and other not strictly opengl related packages. Instead offer overloadable APIs to do the job
* Introduce leaner VertexArray buffer, integrating nicely with view(buffer, faces). A mesh is then basically just view(vertices::Vector{Point3f0}, indices::Vector{GLTriangle})
* Introduce UniformBuffers to hold state in shaders independent of executing the shader
* Introduce lean RenderObject, that doesn't hold any data, besides information on the shader layout - data will get transferred via calling the object with new data. When uniform buffers are used, data can also be updated in place
* remove GLVisualize specific code, that was basically just parked here because I didn't had a better place to put it
* Transpiler integration - make it the main way to create shaders, instead of having ugly templated shader that nobody understands
@@

Besides Transpiler integration, a lot of those goals have been achieved and now effort needs to
be put into writing tests and porting the packages that rely on GLAbstraction to work with the new API.

**Expected Results**: finishing the PR and making sure it works with dependent packages

**Recommended skills**: Requirement is a good understanding of OpenGL

## Port GLVisualize Shaders and improve API of WebVisualize

This project is about turning the current [WebVisualize prototype](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/WebVisualize.jl) into a fully featured webgl
drawing API.
To make things simple, we're using [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) made accessible from within Julia with [WebIO](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/WebIO.jl).
The goal is to port most [GLVisualize](https://github.com/JuliaGL/GLVisualize.jl) shaders so that we can offer exactly the same functionality.
We want to use [Transpiler](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/Transpiler.jl) to transpile the Julia shaders in [Visualize.jl](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/Visualize.jl/tree/master/src/shader) across platforms.
This will enable us to generate webgl shaders and opengl shaders from the same Julia functions, which is crucial to keep maintenance low.

**Expected Results**: Turn the current prototype into a functioning package
**Recommended skills**: Some OpenGL and Web (specifically ThreeJS) knowledge will be required.
**Mentors**: [Simon Danisch](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/)

## VegaLite.jl Improvements

The [VegaLite.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/VegaLite.jl) package provides a Julia wrapper for [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/). There are many areas that could be improved: 1) provide a more powerful [vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) API that is similar to the existing [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) API, 2) complete the [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) API (there are many corner cases that are not ideally handled right now), 3) make things work better for large datasets, 4) come up with a way to auto-convert/integrate the comprehensive vega-lite documentation into the VegaLite.jl documentation, 5) write more documentation, 6) increase test coverage or 7) add a simple non-grammar of graphics API.

**Expected Results**: Some subset of the list mentioned above.

**Recommended Skills**: Familiarity with Julia, vega-lite or vega, and Node.
