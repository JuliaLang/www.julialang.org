#  Graphic Projects – Summer of Code

## VegaLite.jl Improvements

The [VegaLite.jl](https://github.com/queryverse/VegaLite.jl) package provides a Julia wrapper for [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/). There are many areas that could be improved: 1) provide a more powerful [vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) API that is similar to the existing [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) API, 2) complete the [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) API (there are many corner cases that are not ideally handled right now), 3) make things work better for large datasets, 4) come up with a way to auto-convert/integrate the comprehensive vega-lite documentation into the VegaLite.jl documentation, 5) write more documentation, 6) increase test coverage or 7) add a simple non-grammar of graphics API.

**Expected Results**: Some subset of the list mentioned above.

**Recommended Skills**: Familiarity with Julia, vega-lite or vega, and Node.

**Mentors**: [David Anthoff](https://github.com/davidanthoff)
