# Projects

This page lists a bunch of project ideas, meant to serve as starting points as you develop your own plan. You're free to modify them to your tastes, or propose something totally different in an area you're interested in.

We have our project ideas organized roughly into the skill sets required:

@@tight-list
* [Turing projects](/jsoc/gsoc/turing/) for probabilistic modelling and probabilistic programming.
* [Machine Learning](/jsoc/gsoc/flux/) for machine learning.
* [Scientific Machine Learning](/jsoc/gsoc/sciml/)
* [Compiler](/jsoc/gsoc/compiler/) – work on the Julia compiler's internals to make things better for everyone.
* [Web Platform](/jsoc/gsoc/wasm/) – work on the Julia wasm backend or other aspects of julia in the browser.
* [High Performance and Parallel Computing](/jsoc/gsoc/hpc/) – write code that runs on lots of machines, goes really fast, processes lots of data, or all three.
* [Numerics](/jsoc/gsoc/numerics/) – Challenges for the hard–core number-cruncher, including linear algebra routines and basic mathematical functions.
* [Differential Equations](/jsoc/gsoc/diffeq/) - Numerical methods for high-performance solving of differential equation models.
* [Tooling](/jsoc/gsoc/tooling/) – The projects that make the people that make Julia go, go. Help us make a really amazing IDE!
* [Images](/jsoc/gsoc/images/) – extend Julia's suite of tools for visualization and analysis of images.
* [General](/jsoc/gsoc/general/) – jack-of-all-trades projects that don't require special skills.
* [Graphics](/jsoc/gsoc/graphics/) – projects ranging from low level OpenGL rendering to high level plotting.
* [MLJ](/jsoc/gsoc/MLJ/) – a Machine Learning Toolbox for Julia.
* [Pythia](/jsoc/gsoc/pythia/) - scalable time series for Julia.
* [Tabular Data](/jsoc/gsoc/tables/)
* [Continuous time signal processing](/jsoc/gsoc/kalmanbucy/)
* [DeepChem.jl](/jsoc/gsoc/deepchem/) – Machine learning for atomic systems in Julia
* [DFTK.jl](/jsoc/gsoc/dftk/) – Density-functional theory in Julia
