# Projects

This page lists a bunch of project ideas, meant to serve as starting points as you develop your own plan. You're free to modify them to your tastes, or propose something totally different in an area you're interested in.

We have our project ideas organized below roughly by domain but you can also see a [single page with all our projects together](/jsoc/allprojects):

* [BayesianOptimization.jl](/jsoc/gsoc/bayesopt/) - a package for global optimization of black-box functions
* [Compiler](/jsoc/gsoc/compiler/) – work on the Julia compiler's internals to make things better for everyone.
<!--* [Documentation tooling](/jsoc/gsoc/documenter/) - Tooling related to documentation generation, docstrings etc.-->
* [Ferrite FEM](/jsoc/gsoc/ferrite-fem/) - A modern finite element toolbox in Julia.

We also have Julia project's available under other organizations. If you are applying for those projects, make sure your application is for that organization and NOT the Julia Language:
