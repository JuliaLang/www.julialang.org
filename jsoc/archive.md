# Summer of Code Archives

Julia has greatly benefited from Google Summer of Code. In the last 8 years, over 130+ people have contributed to Julia and various Julia packages through the program. Many of these individuals, after their summer projects, have gone on to become regular contributors to the Julia ecosystem.
Take a look to our [Julia Seasons of Contributions Page](/jsoc) and contribute your ideas.

## GSoC 2022

In 2022, we are delighted to recognize Google for its support and funding, as well as our Contributor. Nineteen talented and driven contributors worked on projects, making a meaningful impact. Check out the [Projects List](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2022/organizations/the-julia-language#projects-list) on the GSoC site for a look into what was done in 2022.

## GSoC 2021

In 2021, Google provided great support to our contributors through its program. 20 students contributed to Julia projects: [View Projects](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2021/organizations/5086646441082880#projects-list).


## GSoC 2020

In 2020, we are grateful to Google and the GSoC program for funding [16 awesome  students working on Julia projects](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/organizations/6163109162516480/#projects). In addition to the funding from Google, we [funded an additional 9 students](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-seasons-of-contributions-to-supplement-gsoc-2020/38754) for the summer. 2020 was also the first year of the MLH Fellowship where we had 11 students working on Julia projects across the ecosystem. You can find out more about the 2020 Julia Season of Contributions [on our blog](https://julialang.org/blog/2020/09/gsoc-2020-wrapup/).

## GSoC 2019

In 2019, we received an even larger number of very high quality applications but could only fulfill 15 slots through GSoC. Not wanting to lose some very impressive students and their exciting projects, we decided to supplement the program with the Julia Season of Contributions (JSoC), using some community funds. Details on the program were announced here: [Discourse.julialang : Julia Seasons of Contributions to supplement GSoC](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/julia-seasons-of-contributions-to-supplement-gsoc/23922)

Here is a list of all the [Projects for GSoC and JSoC 2019](/blog/2019/05/jsoc19).

## GSoC 2018

In 2018, Julia participated in GSoC under the [NumFOCUS umbrella organization](/blog/2018/02/gsoc2018-numfocus), and [over 20 projects](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/organizations/6485922656813056/) were supported. Some of the students published their work in the [Julia blog](/blog/).

## GSoC 2017

16 Julia projects were supported in [GSoC 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/organizations/6682672759832576/). Some of the students published their work in the [Julia blog](/blog/).

## GSoC 2016

10 Julia projects were supported in [GSoC 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/organizations/5096506709245952/).

## JSoC 2015

Various projects were proposed by the community in GSOC 2015. However, Julia did not make it to GSOC 2015. Julia organized its own Summer of Code this year thanks to a generous sponsorship for the same from **[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org)**. The projects in Julia Summer of Code 2015 were.
