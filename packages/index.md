# Julia Packages

The Julia ecosystem contains over 4,000 packages that are registered in the [General registry](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General), which means that finding the right package can be a challenge. Fortunately, there are services that can help navigate the ecosystem, including:

* [JuliaHub](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages) — a [Julia Computing](https://juliacomputing.com) service that includes search of all registered open source package documentation, code search, and navigation by tags/keywords.
* [Julia Packages](https://juliapackages.com) — browse Julia packages, filter by categories, and sort them by popularity, creation date or date of last update. Also supports browsing package developers.
* [Julia.jl](https://github.com/svaksha/Julia.jl) — a manually curated taxonomy of Julia packages (category information for JuliaPackages is derived from this as well).
