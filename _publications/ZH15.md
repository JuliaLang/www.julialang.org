Matrix Depot is a Julia software package that provides
easy access to a large and diverse collection of
test matrices. Its novelty is threefold. First, it
is extensible by the user, and so can be adapted to
include the user’s own test problems. In doing so it
facilitates experimentation and makes it easier to
carry out reproducible research. Second, it
amalgamates in a single framework three different
types of matrix collections, comprising parametrized
test matrices, regularization test problems, and
real-life sparse matrix data. Third, it fully
exploits the Julia language. It uses multiple
dispatch to help provide a simple interface and, in
particular, to allow matrices to be generated in any
of the numeric data types supported by the language.
