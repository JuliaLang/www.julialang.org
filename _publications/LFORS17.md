Image processing algorithms require high processing capabilities. Most of these algorithms use linear algebraic operations (BLAS), for instance, through the Combinatorial BLAS [1], and Elemental [2] programming supports. Such operations may require unavailable computer processing resources. CloudArray is funded by Microsoft Azure Research Award, Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), and Alagoas Research Foundation (FAPEAL).
