The JuliaFEM software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large Finite Element Models across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. The basic design principle is: Everything is non-linear. All physics models are non-linear from which the linearizations are made as special cases. This is work in progress. Thus, if you share the vision, contribute and join the community.
