We investigate the use of conformal maps for the acceleration of convergence of the trapezoidal rule and Sinc numerical methods. The conformal map is a polynomial adjustment to the sinh map, and allows the treatment of a finite number of singularities in the complex plane. In the case where locations are unknown, the so-called Sinc-Padé approximants are used to provide approximate results. This adaptive method is shown to have almost the same convergence properties. We use the conformal maps to generate high accuracy solutions to several challenging integrals, nonlinear waves, and multidimensional integrals.
