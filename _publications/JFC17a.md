We introduce an in silico model for the initial spread of an aberrant phenotype 
with Warburg-like overflow metabolism within a healthy homeostatic tissue in 
contact with a nutrient reservoir (the blood), aimed at characterizing the role 
of the microenvironment for aberrant growth. Accounting for cellular metabolic 
activity, competition for nutrients, spatial diffusion and their feedbacks on 
aberrant replication and death rates, we obtain a phase portrait where distinct 
asymptotic whole-tissue states are found upon varying the tissue-blood turnover 
rate and the level of blood-borne primary nutrient. Over a broad range of parameters, 
the spreading dynamics is bistable as random fluctuations can impact the final state 
of the tissue. Such a behaviour turns out to be linked to the re-cycling of overflow 
products by non-aberrant cells. Quantitative insight on the overall emerging picture 
is provided by a spatially homogeneous version of the model.
