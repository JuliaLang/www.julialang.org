GPUs are popular devices for accelerating scientific calculations. However, as
GPU code is usually written in low-level languages, it breaks the abstractions
of high-level languages popular with scientific programmers. To overcome this,
we present a framework for CUDA GPU programming in the high-level Julia
programming language. This framework compiles Julia source code for GPU
execution, and takes care of the necessary low-level interactions using modern
code generation techniques to avoid run-time overhead.

Evaluating the framework and its APIs on a case study comprising the trace
transform from the field of image processing, we find that the impact on
performance is minimal, while greatly increasing programmer productivity. The
metaprogramming capabilities of the Julia language proved invaluable for
enabling this. Our framework significantly improves usability of GPUs, making
them accessible for a wide range of programmers. It is available as free and
