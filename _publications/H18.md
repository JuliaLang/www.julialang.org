GeoStats.jl is an extensible framework for high-performance geostatistics in Julia, as well
as a formal specification of statistical problems in the spatial setting. It provides highly
optimized solvers for estimation and (conditional) simulation of variables defined over general
spatial domains (e.g. regular grid, point collection), and can utilize high-performance
hardware for parallel execution such as GPUs and computer clusters.
