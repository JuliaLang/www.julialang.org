This report presents the results of a friendly competition for formal verification of continuous and hybrid systems with
linear continuous dynamics. The friendly competition took place as part of the workshop Applied Verification for 
Continuous and Hybrid Systems (ARCH) in 2019. In its third edition, seven tools have been applied to solve six different 
benchmark problems in the category for linear continuous dynamics (in alphabetical order): 
CORA, CORA/SX, HyDRA, Hylaa, JuliaReach, SpaceEx, and XSpeed. 
This report is a snapshot of the current landscape of tools and the types of benchmarks they are particularly suited for. 
Due to the diversity of problems, we are not ranking tools, yet the presented results provide one of the most complete 
assessments of tools for the safety verification of continuous and hybrid systems with linear continuous dynamics up to this 
date.
