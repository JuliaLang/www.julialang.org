Brownian  systems  often  surmount  energy  barriers  by  absorbing  and  emitting  heat  to  and  from  their  local
environment.  Usually,  the  temperature  gradients  created  by  this  heat  exchange  are  assumed  to  dissipate
instantaneously.  Here  we  relax  this  assumption  to  consider  the  case  where  Brownian  dynamics  on  a  time-
independent potential can lead to self-induced temperature gradients. In the same way that externally imposed
temperature gradients can cause directed motion, these self-induced gradients affect the dynamics of the Brownian
system. The result is a coupling between the local environment and the Brownian subsystem. We explore the
resulting dynamics and thermodynamics of these coupled systems and develop a robust method for numerical
simulation.  In  particular,  by  focusing  on  one-dimensional  situations,  we  show  that  self-induced  temperature
gradients reduce barrier-crossing rates. We also consider a heat engine and a heat pump based on temperature
gradients induced by a Brownian system in a nonequilibrium potential.
