We solve the stochastic neoclassical growth model, the workhorse of modern
macroeconomics, using C++11, Fortran 2008, Java, Julia, Python, Matlab,
Mathematica, and R. We implement the same algorithm, value function iteration
with grid search, in each of the languages. We report the execution times of the
codes in a Mac and in a Windows computer and brieáy comment on the strengths
and weaknesses of each language.
