Many Earth‐surface processes are studied using field, experimental, or numerical
modeling datasets that represent a small subset of possible outcomes observed in
nature. Based on these data, deterministic models can be built that describe the
average evolution of a system. However, these models commonly cannot account for
the complex variability of many processes or present a quantitative statement of
uncertainty. To assess such uncertainty, stochastic models are needed that can
mimic spatial as well as temporal variability. A common limitation for applying
stochastic models to Earth surface processes is a lack of data and methods that
allow constraining the full spatio‐temporal variability of these models. In this
paper, we propose a Bayesian framework for calibrating input parameters to
stochastic models of morpho‐ dynamic systems using time‐series of image data
from the field, or from numerical and laboratory experiments. The framework
consists of generating synthetic time‐series of images using the stochastic
model, and rejecting those time‐series that do not reproduce key morphodynamic
statistics of the available datasets. The calibrated stochastic model allows us
to quantify both the spatial and temporal uncertainty about the evolution of the
morphodynamic systems of interest. For demonstration purposes, we apply the
framework to a single flume experiment of braided river channels evolving under
steady water and sediment discharges, but it can be used more generally to quantify
spatio‐temporal uncertainty for any time‐series of morphodynamic data for which key
statistics can be defined.
